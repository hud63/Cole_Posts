# Erica Content Generation: Property Taxes Are Theft

## POST 1: Absurdist Conspiracy Theory (2,683 characters)

I figured out why property taxes exist and it's not what you think. This is completely real and I have mathematical proof.

Property = 8 letters
Taxes = 5 letters
8 + 5 = 13

13 is unlucky, right? WRONG.

Turn 13 upside down and you get... still 13. But that's suspicious in itself.

Here's where it gets wild:

If you live in a house for exactly 7 years (the mystical "7-year itch"), your property taxes will have increased exactly 42 times.

42? That's the answer to life, the universe, and everything according to Douglas Adams.

Coincidence? I THINK NOT.

But wait - there's more evidence:

"Property Tax" contains the letters P-R-O-P-E-R-T-Y T-A-X.

Rearrange those letters and you get... okay you can't actually spell anything meaningful, but that's EXACTLY what they want you to think.

The government KNOWS that homeowners who pay $30K in property taxes plus $70K per kid for private school are actually funding a secret program to make gold go parabolic.

Think about it: Gold is up, property taxes are up, private school costs are up. It's all connected through an elaborate Swedish cryptocurrency scheme involving Klarna and Spotify.

This is why DeSantis wants to eliminate property taxes. He's not trying to save Florida residents $3,400 - he's trying to EXPOSE THE TRUTH.

From now on, I'm only living in tents. Can't tax property if it moves every night.

Wake up, homeowners. The algorithms are watching your mortgage payments.

The most financially destructive myth in America?

"Property taxes pay for good schools."

I just talked to a friend paying $30K annually in property taxes AND $70K per kid for private school. For THREE kids.

That's $240K per year. For one family. In New England.

This reveals the massive scam of how we fund education in America:

1. You never actually "own" your home. Miss property tax payments and the government takes your house. You're essentially renting from the state forever, even after your mortgage is paid off.

2. Property taxes fund schools whether you use them or not. Homeschool your kids? Too bad, pay up. Send them to private school? Pay twice. The system forces you to subsidize other people's choices while penalizing your own.

3. Your taxes increase with home valuations, not your income. House value doubles due to inflation? Congratulations, your "rent to the government" just doubled too. You did nothing but exist in your home.

4. School district boundaries create artificial property value manipulation. Live on this side of the street vs. that side? Completely different tax burden for the exact same house.

5. The areas with the highest property taxes often have the worst schools. You're paying premium prices for substandard service with zero recourse.

Here's what makes this especially brutal: During COVID lockdowns, parents discovered their local schools were teaching content completely contrary to their values. They pulled their kids out en masse, yet still had to pay the same crushing property taxes.

The solution isn't minor reform. It's systematic disruption.

States like Florida and Texas are pioneering school choice programs that let parents redirect education funding to private schools, charter schools, or homeschooling.

DeSantis is now proposing to eliminate property taxes entirely. This would save Florida residents an average of $3,400 annually while forcing a complete reimagining of local government funding.

The result? True home ownership. Educational freedom. And an end to the government's rental payments on your own property.

Ready to support property tax elimination in your state?

## POST 3: Declarative Expertise (2,541 characters)

Property taxes are theft. Period. And I'm tired of people defending this un-American system.

Look, I've spent 15 years analyzing tax policy and government finance structures. I've seen how property taxes destroy wealth accumulation, particularly for middle-class families trying to build generational assets.

The numbers don't lie: Friends of mine are paying $30K in property taxes plus $70K per kid for private schools. That's $240K annually for a family with three children. In what universe is this sustainable or fair?

Here's the truth that politicians don't want you to understand:

Property taxes violate the fundamental principle of ownership. If you have to pay the government annual tribute to keep your house, you don't own anything. You're a tenant of the state.

I've analyzed dozens of local government budgets. The vast majority of property tax revenue goes to fund public schools that are hemorrhaging students and failing academically. We're forcing homeowners to subsidize a system they increasingly don't use or trust.

The COVID lockdowns exposed this perfectly. Millions of parents discovered their local schools were teaching ideology contrary to their values. They pulled their kids out, started homeschooling or chose private education. Yet they still had to pay the same crushing property taxes.

DeSantis gets it. His proposal to eliminate property taxes in Florida isn't just good policy - it's the logical conclusion of what we learned during the pandemic. When government services fail to deliver value, why should we be forced to fund them?

Texas is following the same path. States that eliminate property taxes will see massive population inflows from overtaxed regions like New England and California.

This creates a competitive dynamic that forces innovation in both education and local government efficiency.

The results speak for themselves: Florida is experiencing unprecedented growth while high-tax states are losing residents and businesses.

Property tax elimination isn't radical. It's a return to actual property ownership - the foundational principle that built American wealth.

Every state should be planning this transition. The question isn't whether property taxes will disappear, but which states will lead and which will follow.

True ownership means never paying rent to the government for your own home.

## POST 4: Vulnerable Self-Reflection (2,799 characters)

"Property taxes are just part of homeownership." I used to accept this without question, the way you accept traffic or bad weather - as an inevitable frustration of adult life.

But yesterday I read about a family paying $30K in property taxes plus $70K per kid for private school. For three kids. That's $240K annually.

And something broke open in my thinking.

How did we normalize government rental payments on our own homes?

I've been wrestling with this because I grew up believing property taxes were how we funded good schools and essential services. It felt civic-minded, responsible.

But then I started asking uncomfortable questions:

- Why do I pay property taxes even after my mortgage is paid off?
- Why do my taxes increase when my house value goes up, regardless of my income?
- Why am I forced to fund schools I don't use while paying separately for my kids' education?

The deeper I dig, the more I realize I've been defending a system that fundamentally contradicts the idea of ownership.

---

Here's what's hard to admit: I think I accepted property taxes because they felt "normal." Everyone pays them. It's just how things work.

But normal doesn't mean right.

During COVID, millions of parents discovered their local schools were teaching content contrary to their family values. They made the difficult choice to homeschool or switch to private education.

Yet they still had to pay the same property taxes funding the system they rejected.

That's not civic duty. That's coercion.

DeSantis is proposing to eliminate property taxes in Florida entirely. My first reaction was skepticism - how would schools get funded? How would local governments operate?

But then I realized: I was asking the wrong questions.

The right questions are:
- Why should failing schools be guaranteed funding regardless of performance?
- Why should local governments have access to unlimited revenue streams through property value increases?
- Why should homeowners be forced to subsidize services they don't use?

---

I'm starting to believe that true property ownership - the kind that built American wealth - means never paying rent to the government for your own home.

This isn't about being anti-tax. It's about questioning systems that treat citizens as permanent tenants of the state.

The more I think about it, the more I see property taxes as fundamentally un-American. We fought a revolution over "taxation without representation," yet property taxes often fund institutions (like school boards) that actively oppose community values.

---

What's your take? Am I overthinking this, or have we normalized something that deserves serious reconsideration?

Is the idea of paying annual tribute to keep your own home something we should defend, or dismantle?
