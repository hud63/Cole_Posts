## 8:30am PT - Paragraph Style (277 characters)
The era of typing code is ending. AI writes 41% of all code now. Smart developers aren't fighting this—they're building systems that compound. Every bug fix becomes a lesson. Every code review becomes permanent knowledge. Stop coding. Start teaching machines to code for you.

## 11:00am PT - What/How/Why (275 characters)
AI has already fixed your code before you saw the problem.

• Build experiment logs that capture failures
• Create context files that reflect your reality  
• Set up three-lane development workflows
• Trust systems, verify through automation

Because leverage shifts to those who teach machines faster than they type.

## 1:00pm PT - Listicle (258 characters)
4 signs you're still stuck in the old coding paradigm:

• You're typing more than you're thinking
• You fix the same bugs repeatedly
• Your AI context is generic copy-paste
• You review every line manually

Time to build systems that compound instead.

## 3:30pm PT - Old vs New (254 characters)
Old developers:
• Type every line manually
• Fix bugs one by one
• Copy generic AI prompts

New developers:
• Build systems that learn
• Turn failures into lessons
• Create personal AI context

The future belongs to system builders, not line typers.

## 7:00pm PT - 10 Magical Ways (276 characters)
3 ways compounding engineering beats traditional coding:

• Experiment logs turn every failure into permanent knowledge
• Lean context makes AI reflect your actual patterns
• Three-lane workflows separate thinking from typing
