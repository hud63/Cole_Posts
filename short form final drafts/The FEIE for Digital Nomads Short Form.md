# Short Form Content - The FEIE for Digital Nomads

## 8:30am PT - Paragraph Style
The IRS has a $130,000 gift for digital nomads, but 99% don't know it exists. Spend 330 days outside America, file one form, and eliminate your entire US income tax legally. One couple got $10,000+ back. The catch? Perfect documentation and zero room for error.

## 11am PT - What/How/Why
Americans can exclude $130k from US taxes while nomading.

• Stay outside US for 330+ days annually
• Track every location with precision
• File Form 2555 with tax return
• Maintain detailed travel records

This saves $20,000+ yearly in federal taxes.

## 1pm PT - Listicle
4 FEIE benefits most nomads miss:

• Zero US tax on first $130k earned abroad
• Flexible 12-month period (not calendar year)
• Works with regular US remote jobs
• Can delay filing until qualifying period complete

It's legal tax elimination, not avoidance.

## 3:30pm PT - Old vs New
Traditional Expats:
• Pay tax to foreign country
• Use tax treaties
• Complex dual obligations

Digital Nomads:
• Pay tax to no country
• Use FEIE exclusion  
• Simple US filing only

Smart nomads choose zero taxes over double taxes.

## 7pm PT - 10 Magical Ways
5 mistakes that kill your $130k FEIE exclusion:

• Spending 36+ days in America

One error costs $20k+ annually.
