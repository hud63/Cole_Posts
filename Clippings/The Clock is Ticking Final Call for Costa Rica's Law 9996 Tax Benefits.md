Don’t Miss Out on Thousands in Savings: Your Last Chance to Capitalize on Costa Rica’s Investor, Rentista, and Pensionado Attraction Law

Time is running out for foreign investors, retirees (pensionados), and individuals with stable foreign income (rentistas) to take advantage of significant tax exemptions offered under Costa Rica’s Law 9996. Enacted on July 14, 2021, to stimulate the post-pandemic economy, this landmark legislation offers a five-year window for new residents to secure substantial financial incentives. With the application deadline of July 14, 2026, fast approaching, the time to act is now. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Law 9996, its benefits, the application process, and why you must start the process immediately to avoid missing this golden opportunity.

As a leading authority in Costa Rican immigration and residency, CRIE is committed to providing you with the most accurate and up-to-date information. We have helped numerous clients navigate the complexities of Law 9996, saving them between $10,000 and $35,000 in tax exemptions on household goods and vehicles. This article will provide you with the expert insights you need to make an informed decision about your future in Costa Rica.

Understanding Law 9996: A Golden Ticket to Pura Vida

Law 9996, officially titled the “Law for the Attraction of Investors, Rentistas, and Pensionados,” was designed to make Costa Rica an even more attractive destination for foreign capital and residents. The law provides a range of powerful tax incentives for those who qualify under the investor, rentista, or pensionado residency categories. However, these benefits are not permanent. The law explicitly states that the opportunity to apply for these benefits is limited to the first five years from its entry into force, making the July 14, 2026, deadline a critical date for anyone considering a move to Costa Rica.

Who is Eligible for Law 9996 Benefits?

The benefits of Law 9996 are available to foreigners who are granted temporary residency in Costa Rica under one of the following three categories:

Investors (Inversionistas): Individuals who make a qualifying investment in Costa Rica. Under Law 9996, the minimum investment amount was reduced from $200,000 to $150,000 USD.
Retirees (Pensionados): Individuals who receive a lifetime pension of at least $1,000 USD per month.
Rentistas: Individuals who can demonstrate a stable, non-salaried income of at least $2,500 USD per month for a minimum of two years.

It is crucial to understand that you must first be approved for one of these residency categories to be eligible for the tax benefits under Law 9996. The tax exemption application is a separate process that can only be initiated after your residency has been granted.

The Clock is Ticking: Why You Must Act Now

The most critical aspect of Law 9996 is its expiration date. While the benefits themselves last for ten years from the date they are granted, the window to apply for them closes on July 14, 2026. What many people don’t realize is that the application process for both residency and the subsequent tax exemptions can be lengthy. The process of applying for tax exemptions through the government’s online platform, EXONET, can take up to two months alone. This does not include the time it takes to gather the necessary documentation and obtain your residency approval.

Given these timelines, it is imperative to begin the process as soon as possible. Waiting until the last minute could result in missing the deadline and losing out on thousands of dollars in savings. At CRIE, we are already seeing a surge in applications as the deadline approaches. We urge you to contact us for a free consultation to assess your eligibility and start your application process today.

A Treasure Trove of Benefits: What You Stand to Gain

The tax incentives offered under Law 9996 are substantial and can significantly reduce the cost of relocating to Costa Rica. Here is a detailed breakdown of the benefits you can receive:

One-Time Exemption on Household Goods

Imagine bringing all your cherished household belongings to your new home in Costa Rica without paying a single penny in import taxes. Law 9996 makes this possible with a one-time, 100% exemption on all import duties and tariffs for your household goods (menaje de casa). This includes everything from furniture and appliances to home decor and kitchen utensils. The only condition is that the items must be of a reasonable quantity for your family’s needs. It is important to note that if you sell or transfer these items within ten years, you will be required to pay the exempted taxes.

Tax-Free Importation of Up to Two Vehicles

One of the most significant benefits of Law 9996 is the ability to import up to two vehicles for personal or family use, completely free of all import taxes, tariffs, and value-added taxes. This can result in tens of thousands of dollars in savings, as vehicle import taxes in Costa Rica are notoriously high. The vehicles can be for land, air, or sea transport. As with household goods, you must retain ownership of the vehicles for a minimum of ten years to avoid paying the exempted taxes.

Income Tax Exemption

Under Law 9996, the income you declare to qualify for your residency category (e.g., your pension or rentista income) is completely exempt from Costa Rican income tax. This is a significant advantage that can help you preserve your wealth and enjoy a higher disposable income in Costa Rica. However, it is important to note that any income generated from investments made within Costa Rica is still subject to local income tax laws.

20% Exemption on Property Transfer Tax

If you purchase real estate in Costa Rica during the validity period of your Law 9996 benefits, you will receive a 20% exemption on the property transfer tax. This can result in substantial savings, especially on high-value properties. To qualify, the property must be registered in your personal name.

Exemption on Professional and Scientific Equipment

For those who plan to work or conduct research in Costa Rica, Law 9996 provides an exemption on import taxes for instruments and materials related to your professional or scientific activities. You will need to demonstrate to the Ministry of Finance that the imported items are necessary for your work and are of a reasonable quantity.

Navigating the Application Process: A Step-by-Step Guide

While the benefits of Law 9996 are substantial, the application process can be complex. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process:

1. Determine Your Eligibility: The first step is to determine which residency category you qualify for: investor, pensionado, or rentista. CRIE can help you assess your eligibility and choose the best option for your circumstances.
2. Gather Your Documents: You will need to gather a significant amount of documentation for your residency application, including your birth certificate, marriage certificate (if applicable), police records, and proof of income or investment. All documents must be apostilled or legalized in your home country.
3. Submit Your Residency Application: Once you have all your documents in order, you can submit your residency application to the Costa Rican Department of Immigration (DGME). This can be a complex process, and we highly recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney to ensure your application is complete and accurate.
4. Obtain Residency Approval: The DGME will review your application and, if everything is in order, will grant you temporary residency. This process can take several months.
5. Apply for Tax Exemptions through EXONET: Once you have your residency approval, you can begin the process of applying for your tax exemptions through the EXONET platform. This is where you will need to work with a customs broker to submit your application for the exemption on your household goods and vehicles.
6. Receive Your Exemptions: The EXONET process can take up to two months. Once your application is approved, you will be able to import your household goods and vehicles tax-free.

The Investor Category: A Closer Look at the $150,000 Investment

Law 9996 made the investor residency category more accessible by reducing the minimum investment amount from $200,000 to $150,000 USD. However, the regulations have also introduced some important changes to how this investment can be made. Here are the key points to be aware of:

Real Estate: If you are investing in real estate, the property must be titled in your personal name. The regulations no longer accept investments in properties held by a Costa Rican corporation. This is a significant change from previous practice.
Other Investment Options: In addition to real estate, you can also invest in a variety of other assets, including:
	- Registrable assets such as vehicles, machinery, or equipment
	- Shares in a Costa Rican company (the company must have economic activity)
	- Securities and negotiable instruments through a licensed Costa Rican brokerage
	- Productive projects or projects of national interest
	- Venture capital funds
	- Sustainable tourism infrastructure projects
