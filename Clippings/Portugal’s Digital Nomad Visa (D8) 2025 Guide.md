If you’ve ever dreamed of working remotely from Portugal—think ocean views, cobblestone streets, and pastel de nata on your coffee break—the D8 Visa might be your ticket.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to live and work legally in Portugal as a digital nomad.

Portugal Digital Nomad Visa (D8) Overview

 The Portugal D8 Visa, commonly referred to as the Digital Nomad Visa, is a residence visa created for remote workers, freelancers, and independent contractors who earn income from outside Portugal. Introduced in October 2022, the D8 allows non-EU/EEA/Swiss nationals to legally live in Portugal while working remotely.

There are two versions of the D8 Visa:

Temporary Stay Visa: Valid for up to 1 year, renewable for short periods. Ideal for digital nomads who want to try living in Portugal without committing long-term.
Residency Visa: Valid initially for 4 months, after which you apply for a 2-year residence permit. This option can be renewed and eventually lead to permanent residency or citizenship.

To qualify, applicants must demonstrate a stable remote income, meet minimum earnings thresholds, and provide documentation proving they work for a foreign employer, operate a business, or freelance for international clients.

This visa is one of the most accessible digital nomad options in Europe, combining lifestyle perks with a clear path to longer-term residency.

Who Can Apply for the Portugal Digital Nomad Visa?

 The Portugal Digital Nomad Visa (D8) is available to non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who work remotely and earn income from outside Portugal. If you're a freelancer, remote employee, or business owner working with foreign clients or companies, and you meet the income requirements, you’re likely eligible to apply, regardless of your nationality.

U.S. Citizens and Green Card Holders

U.S. citizens can apply for the D8 visa through their local Portuguese consulate. Green Card holders can also apply, but they must ensure their U.S. residency permit is valid for at least three months beyond their intended stay in Portugal. All applicants must meet the minimum monthly income requirement of around €3,480/month gross.

Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand Citizens

Citizens of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are fully eligible to apply under the same terms as U.S. citizens, provided they meet the income and documentation requirements.

EU/EEA/Swiss Citizens

If you're from an EU/EEA country or Switzerland, you do not need a visa to live and work in Portugal. However, if you stay more than 90 days, you’ll need to register your residence locally (via AIMA, formerly SEF) within 30 days of arrival.

Citizens of Other Countries

If you’re from another country outside the EU/EEA/Switzerland, you can also apply for the D8 visa as long as you meet the eligibility criteria, including proof of remote income and accommodation in Portugal.

Portugal Digital Nomad Visa Requirements (D8 Visa)

 Before applying for Portugal’s D8 Digital Nomad Visa, it’s important to make sure you meet the eligibility criteria and have all your documents in order. Here's what you’ll need to qualify and apply successfully.

To qualify for the D8 Digital Nomad Visa, you must:

Earn a monthly income of at least €3,480 (gross) — equivalent to four times the Portuguese minimum wage
Have a clean criminal record
Show proof of accommodation in Portugal for at least 12 months

Once you arrive in Portugal, you must also obtain a Portuguese tax number (NIF) and open a local bank account before applying for your residence permit.

Proof of Remote Income

You must show that you meet the income threshold. Depending on your work situation, you can submit:

Remote employees: employment contract + last 3 months of payslips or bank statements

Proof of Accommodation

You must present a valid lease, hotel booking, Airbnb reservation, or a signed letter from a host in Portugal. Ideally, this should cover 12 months, but shorter stays (e.g. 6 months) with a written explanation may be accepted at the consulate’s discretion.

NIF (Portuguese Tax Number)

You’ll need a NIF to open a bank account and apply for residency. It can be obtained:

In person at a Finanças (Tax Office) or Loja do Cidadão
Via a local representative or lawyer if applying remotely

Required: passport, proof of address, and visa (if applicable).

A minimum of €30,000

You can switch to a local plan once your residence permit is issued.

Be issued within the last 90 days
Include an Apostille

How to Apply for the Portugal Digital Nomad Visa (D8) – Step-by-Step Instructions

 Applying for the D8 Digital Nomad Visa involves several steps, both in your home country and once you arrive in Portugal. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown to help you navigate the process:

Step 1: Gather Your Documents

Before applying, prepare the following required documents:

Valid passport (must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay)
Completed national visa application form (available from your Portuguese consulate)
Proof of remote income (contracts, payslips, or business documents showing at least €3,480/month)
Bank statements from the last 3 months
Proof of accommodation in Portugal for 12 months
Proof of health insurance with €30,000 coverage
Criminal background check (with Apostille + official translation if required)
NIF (Portuguese tax number)
Portuguese bank account details
Cover letter explaining your remote work, reason for choosing Portugal, and intent to comply with visa terms

Step 2: Apply at the Portuguese Consulate in Your Country

You must apply for the D8 visa before entering Portugal, at the Portuguese embassy or consulate in your country of residence.

Book an appointment early — wait times can vary from a few weeks to a few months.
Submit your documents in person at the appointment.
Pay the visa fee, which is usually around €90–€120.

Once approved, you’ll receive a 120-day visa that allows you to enter Portugal and attend your residency interview.

Step 3: Travel to Portugal

After receiving your visa, you can enter Portugal and begin preparing for your residence permit application.

You’ll need to attend an appointment with AIMA (formerly SEF) during your 120-day window.
You may receive the appointment date in your visa documents or be asked to schedule it yourself.

Step 4: Attend Your AIMA (SEF) Appointment

At your appointment, you’ll submit your biometric data and finalize your residence permit application.

Bring the same documents you submitted for your visa, along with any updated paperwork. Your permit is typically valid for two years, renewable for an additional three years.

Once you receive your residence card:

Register your local address at the town hall (Câmara Municipal)
Enroll in Portugal’s tax system if you're staying 183+ days per year
Switch to local health coverage or continue with private insurance

After five years of residency, you may be eligible to apply for permanent residence or citizenship.

Timeline for Applying for a Portugal Digital Nomad Visa

The entire process to apply for the D8 Digital Nomad Visa typically takes 2 to 4 months, depending on your country of residence and how quickly you gather your documents. Here’s a rough breakdown:

Document Preparation: 2–4 weeks (may take longer if you need background checks or apostilles)
Visa Appointment & Processing: 4–8 weeks after submitting your application to the Portuguese consulate
Travel & Residency Appointment in Portugal: Within 120 days of visa approval
Residence Permit Issued: 2–6 weeks after your AIMA (formerly SEF) appointment

To avoid delays, start preparing your documents as early as possible and book your consulate appointment well in advance.

How Much Does it Cost to Apply for a Portugal Digital Nomad Visa?

 Applying for the D8 Digital Nomad Visa comes with a few necessary fees. While costs may vary slightly depending on your consulate and personal situation, here’s what you can generally expect:

Visa Application Fee: €90–€120 (paid to the Portuguese consulate)
Residence Permit Fee: Around €170 (paid at your AIMA appointment in Portugal)
Additional Costs (varies by applicant):
	- Criminal background check and apostille
	- Document translations and notarizations
	- NIF registration (if using a service): ~€50–€100
	- Portuguese bank account setup (some banks charge opening fees)

Altogether, most applicants can expect to spend €300–€600 on required fees, not including travel and accommodation.

Paying Taxes on a Portugal Digital Nomad Visa

If you stay in Portugal for more than 183 days in a 12-month period—or establish a habitual residence—you’ll become a Portuguese tax resident and will be subject to taxation on your global income.

Until recently, Portugal offered the Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) tax regime, which allowed new residents to benefit from generous tax breaks for up to 10 years. However, the NHR program officially ended for most new applicants as of January 1, 2024, though some transitional rules still apply to those who registered before the deadline.

Without NHR, remote workers and digital nomads under the D8 visa will be taxed under Portugal’s standard personal income tax system, which is progressive up to 48%. That said, freelancers and independent contractors may be eligible for simplified tax regimes with reduced effective rates depending on their type of income.

Here are a few important tax notes for digital nomads:

Cryptocurrency: Capital gains from crypto are tax-free if held for more than 365 days. Shorter holding periods are taxed.
Foreign income: If you remain a tax resident in your home country or benefit from a double taxation agreement, you may not be taxed twice, but always consult a tax advisor.
Social security: You might be exempt if you're already contributing to a social security system abroa,d and Portugal has a bilateral agreement with that country.

If you're planning to live in Portugal long-term under the D8 visa, it’s a good idea to speak with a Portuguese tax advisor early to make sure you’re set up for compliance and optimization.

Portugal Digital Nomad Visa Denial

 If your Portugal Digital Nomad (D8) Visa application is denied, it’s usually due to missing documentation, not meeting income thresholds, or submitting unverified translations. Because of this, it’s essential to prepare all documents thoroughly—translated, notarized, and apostilled where required.

When a visa is denied, you will typically receive a written explanation from the consulate or embassy outlining the reason for the refusal. Common issues include:

Incomplete or missing documentation
Insufficient proof of income
Unclear accommodation plans
Criminal record concerns
Errors in the visa application form

If your application was denied due to correctable issues (like missing financial proof or an incomplete business plan), you can file an appeal rather than starting from scratch. You must submit your appeal within 30 days of the denial notice.

To appeal:

Write a formal appeal letter explaining your situation
Address the reason for denial and attach updated documents
Submit the appeal through the consulate where you applied

Appeals usually take 4 to 8 weeks to process. Submitting a complete and well-documented appeal increases your chances of success and avoids triggering an automatic refusal based on your prior denial.

If you're unsure how to proceed, it may be worth consulting with a Portuguese immigration lawyer or visa specialist to strengthen your appeal.

Other Visa Options for Digital Nomads, Remote Workers, and Retirees

Portugal offers several visa pathways for digital nomads and remote workers who want to live in the country—ranging from short stays to long-term residency. Below is a breakdown of the main visa types and what they’re best suited for.

D8 Digital Nomad Visa (Temporary Stay or Residency Visa)

The D8 Visa was introduced in October 2022 specifically for remote workers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who earn income from outside Portugal.

Temporary Stay Visa: Best for digital nomads who want to stay in Portugal for up to 1 year. It’s renewable for short periods but does not lead to permanent residency.
Residency Visa: Comes with a 4-month visa to enter Portugal, during which you apply for a 2-year residence permit that can be renewed and eventually lead to permanent residency or citizenship.

D7 Passive Income Visa

The D7 Visa is best suited for retirees and individuals with passive income such as pensions, dividends, royalties, or rental income—not active remote work or freelance income.

To qualify, you need:

Proof of regular passive income equivalent to at least the Portuguese minimum wage annually (~€8,460/year for individuals in 2025).
An additional 50% for a spouse (€4,230/year) and 30% per dependent child (€2,538/year).
Proof of long-term accommodation in Portugal.
A NIF and Portuguese bank account.

You'll first receive a 4-month visa to enter Portugal and apply for a 2-year residence permit. Like the D8, the D7 offers a path to permanent residency and citizenship.

D2 Entrepreneur Visa

The D2 Visa is aimed at entrepreneurs and independent professionals looking to launch or expand a business in Portugal.

To qualify, you must:

Own a business, plan to start one in Portugal, or invest in a Portuguese business.
Show a business plan that demonstrates economic viability and local benefit.
Show funds to support yourself and your business (at least one year of minimum wage income, ~€8,460).
You do not need to show a specific investment threshold, but €5,000+ is typically expected.

You’ll receive a 4-month visa to enter Portugal and apply for a 2-year residence permit. This visa is renewable and leads to permanent residency and citizenship.

Portugal Golden Visa

The Golden Visa is a residency-by-investment program. It’s not intended for digital nomads, but is an option for those able to make a significant financial investment in Portugal.

Minimum investment options include:

€500,000 in an investment fund (such as a venture capital fund supporting Portuguese companies).
€250,000 donation to cultural heritage or €500,000 to scientific research.
Job creation: Invest in a business that creates 10 new jobs.

Note:

Real estate investment is no longer eligible under the Golden Visa as of 2023.
You only need to spend 7 days per year in Portugal to maintain the visa.
The visa leads to permanent residency and citizenship after 5 years, with minimal stay requirements.

Schengen Short-Stay Visa (Tourist Visa)

Citizens of many countries —including the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and Brazil—can enter Portugal visa-free for up to 90 days within a 180-day period.

This visa is ideal for:

Short visits or “workcations”
Exploring Portugal before applying for a long-term visa

To apply (if needed), you'll need:

A valid passport
Round-trip travel reservations
Proof of accommodation
Travel insurance with at least €30,000 coverage
Proof of financial means
Visa application form and fee

Frequent travelers may apply for a multi-year Schengen visa, valid up to 5 years, with the same 90/180 rule.

Which Portugal Visa Type is Best for Digital Nomads?

For digital nomads, the D8 Visa is the clear winner. Unlike other visa types, the D8 was specifically designed for remote workers and freelancers who earn income from outside Portugal. It offers a straightforward legal path to live and work in Portugal while maintaining your foreign income, with both short-term (up to 1 year) and long-term residency options that can lead to permanent residence or citizenship. It also aligns better with how most digital nomads live and work—independent, location-flexible, and earning income online.

While the D7 Visa was previously used by remote workers, it’s now largely reserved for those with passive income like pensions or rental earnings. Applications from active freelancers or employees are increasingly rejected under the D7 category. Meanwhile, the D2 and Golden Visas target entrepreneurs and investors, not remote professionals. If you're working online, traveling light, and want a visa tailored to that lifestyle, the D8 is your best—and most appropriate—choice.
