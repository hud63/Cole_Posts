Certainly. Based on the forum discussion, here are the details on the "true" offshore jurisdictions advocated by the user OVZA LLC.

"True" or **traditional offshore jurisdictions** are countries that have specifically designed their laws to attract international business by creating corporate structures, often called **International Business Companies (IBCs)**, for non-residents. These jurisdictions, like the **Bahamas** and **Seychelles**, intentionally separate their domestic economy from this international corporate activity.

Their primary appeal, as highlighted by OVZA LLC, is their simplicity and extremely low cost.

### Key Characteristics

- **Zero-Tax Environment:** The most significant feature is that IBCs registered in these jurisdictions typically pay **0% corporate tax** on income earned outside the country. üèùÔ∏è
    
- **Simplicity and Speed:** Incorporation is designed to be fast and bureaucratic-free. A new company can often be set up in just one or two days with minimal paperwork.
    
- **Minimal Reporting:** These structures usually have very few compliance requirements. They often don't need to file annual financial audits or detailed tax returns in the jurisdiction of incorporation.
    
- **Privacy:** Historically, these jurisdictions offered high levels of confidentiality regarding the company's owners and directors. While global transparency initiatives have reduced this, they remain more private than onshore registries.

### The Low-Cost Advantage

This is the main point OVZA LLC emphasizes. The business model of these jurisdictions is based on volume, not high fees per company.

- **Setup Cost:** Registering an IBC in the Seychelles or a similar jurisdiction can cost as little as **a few hundred dollars**.
    
- **Annual Renewal:** Maintaining the company is also very cheap, typically involving a few hundred dollars per year paid to the registered agent and the government.
    

OVZA LLC presents this as a "lean, efficient way" to operate, contrasting it sharply with the ¬£10,490+ quote the original poster received for a UAE setup.
