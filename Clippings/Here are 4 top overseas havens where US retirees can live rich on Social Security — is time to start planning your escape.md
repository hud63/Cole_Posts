Common retirement fears — like higher taxes, inflation, and outliving savings — often share a single root cause: the high cost of living.

If you could significantly reduce your living expenses in retirement, many of these concerns would diminish — and you might even be able to retire with a smaller nest egg than expected.

Lower monthly costs could also allow you to rely more on Social Security, which averaged $1,863 per month as of July 2025, to cover your needs.

Fortunately, there is a possible solution: moving abroad. According to a recent survey by Western & Southern Financial Group, nearly 34% of Americans have considered relocating to another country to reduce living costs.

If you’re among them, here are four top overseas retirement destinations to consider for your golden years.

Phuket, Thailand

Known for its tropical climate and gorgeous beaches, Thailand also has a reputation for being one of the most affordable places to retire. As of 2025, the cost of living in Thailand is approximately 53.3% lower than in the United States, according to Numbeo.

Retirees can take advantage of the country’s Non-Immigrant O-A Visa, which is specifically designed for individuals aged 50 or older.

To qualify, applicants must show a monthly income of at least 65,000 Baht (around $2,000 USD) and maintain valid health insurance. The visa allows you to live in Thailand for one year and can be renewed indefinitely, making it ideal for retirees with consistent passive income.

While there are many attractive cities in Thailand, Phuket stands out for its expat-heavy population, pristine beaches, and access to quality private healthcare, according to Forbes.

Monthly living costs for a single person in Phuket are estimated at just $736, according to Numbeo — making it possible for many couples to retire comfortably on Social Security alone.

Mendoza, Argentina

Living in Argentina is nearly as affordable as Thailand, with costs approximately 49.8% lower than in the United States, according to Numbeo.

However, one of the biggest advantages of retiring in Latin America is the language. If you’re among the 41.7 million Americans who speak Spanish, according to Census Bureau data, Argentina could feel both accessible and welcoming.

However, language isn’t a barrier for eligibility to the country’s retirement visa. Argentina’s Pensioner (Jubilado) visa is available to women aged 60+ and men aged 65+ who receive a pension equal to at least five times the country’s minimum wage. For those with passive income from sources like dividends or rental properties, the Rentista visa is an alternative.

Buenos Aires could be a great destination, but the cost of living is 17.3% lower in a small city like Mendoza, according to Numbeo.

Regardless of location, life in Argentina is generally affordable. A single person can expect to live on around $705 per month.

Santa Marta, Colombia

Colombia offers many of the same advantages as Argentina for Spanish-speaking retirees seeking a lower cost of living — but with an edge in healthcare.

According to Forbes, Colombia has one of the best healthcare systems in Latin America, which makes it an ideal destination for older Americans.

The country’s retirement visa (Pensionado Visa) is also relatively accessible. Retirees only need a guaranteed monthly income of at least three times the national minimum wage — around $1,000 — according to Columbia Visa Services.

The cost of living in Columbia is approximately 63.3% lower than the U.S. and smaller cities can be even more affordable. For example, living in Santa Marta is about 6% cheaper than living in the capital Bogotá, according to Numbeo.

Overall, a single person can expect to live comfortably in Columbia on around $534 per month. That makes it possible to qualify for the visa and cover living expenses on Social Security alone.

Manila, The Philippines

The Philippines may not be a top retirement destination, but it offers a low cost of living and a vibrant culture.

The country’s Special Resident Retiree's Visa (SRRV) is open to anyone over the age of 35 who meets minimum passive income or investment retirements, according to Wise — making early retirement a viable option.

The cost of living is about 62% lower than the United States, and even in Manila, monthly expenses can be as low as $646 per person, according to Numbeo.
