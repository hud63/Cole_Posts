It’s called a Solo 401k and way more people qualify than you think

It’s arguably the most powerful retirement + tax optimization tools in America, and yet most people don’t even know it exists


A Solo 401k is a powerful retirement plan designed specifically for business owners, self-employed individuals, and freelancers. Unlike traditional employer-sponsored 401k plans, a Solo 401k is built for one person-you-and gives you unmatched flexibility and control over how you save for retirement. Here's the best part: it combines the perks of a corporate 401k (like high contribution limits) with the freedom to run it your way.

Let's break this down a bit more:

### THE BASICS

---

A Solo 401k works just like a regular 401k but is tailored for individuals who don't have employees (other than a spouse).

It allows you to save money for retirement while reducing your taxable income, and you can choose where to invest those savings-from traditional options like stocks and bonds to alternative assets like real estate and even crypto.

You get to act as both the employee and the employer, giving you the ability to maximize contributions.

**EXAMPLE**

Imagine you're a freelance graphic designer making $80,000 a year.

With a Solo 401k, you get to play two roles:

As the employee, you can set aside part of your income for retirement.

As the employer, you can also contribute to your retirement savings from your business profits.

This means you're not limited to saving like a regular employee-you can save more because you're both the boss and the worker. This combination is what makes the Solo 401k so powerful for business owners and freelancers.

### **WHY IT'S BUILT FOR YOU**

---

A Solo 401k is perfect if you:

- Run a business by yourself or with your spouse.
- Earn any self-employment income (whether it's your main gig or a side hustle).
- Want to take control of your retirement savings without relying on an employer.

You don't need to run a multimillion-dollar business to open a Solo 401k-it works just as well for a part-time freelancer as it does for a full-time entrepreneur.

### **SAVE MORE WITH HIGHER CONTRIBUTION LIMITS**

---

A Solo 401k allows you to save more money compared to other retirement plans. Why? Because you get to contribute as both the employee and the employer. This means you can save far more than you could with an IRA or even a corporate 401k plan.

Why this matters: The more you save, the faster your money can potentially grow over time, helping you retire comfortably or even early.

### **CUT YOUR TAXES**

---

When you contribute to a Solo 401k, you can lower the amount of income the IRS taxes you on. Let's say you made $60,000 this year and contributed $20,000 to your Solo 401k. You'd only be taxed on $40,000 of income.

Bonus: If you choose the Roth option, your contributions don't lower your taxable income today, but they grow tax-free, and you won't pay taxes when you withdraw them in retirement.

### **INVEST IN ALMOST ANY ASSET CLASS**

---

Unlike many retirement plans, a Solo 401k gives you the freedom to invest in a variety of different asset classes:

- Traditional assets: Stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds.
- Alternative assets: Real estate, crypto, private equity, and startups.

Example: You could use your Solo 401k to invest in a rental property or even fund a friend's startup. This flexibility allows you to potentially align your investments with your personal interests and goals.

### TAX-FREE COMPOUNDING

---

As you buy and sell investments in your Solo 401k, you don't have to pay taxes on potential gains or income. This means more of your money stays in your account, potentially growing faster over time.

How it works: You invest $10,000 in a stock, and it grows to $15,000. If you sell the stock, you will not be taxed on the $5,000 gain- so long as it stays in your Solo 401k.

### OPTION FOR ROTH CONTRIBUTIONS

---

A Roth Solo 401k lets you contribute after-tax money. While this doesn't lower your taxable income today, any potential growth will grow tax-free, and you won't owe a dime in taxes when you withdraw it in retirement.

Why this is great: If you think your tax rate will be higher in the future, the Roth option can save you big money down the road.

### BORROW MONEY FROM YOUR PLAN

---

Need cash? A Solo 401k allows you to borrow up to 50% of your account balance (up to $50,000).

Example: If your account balance is $40,000, you can borrow $20,000 and pay it back with interest -but here's the kicker: the interest goes back into your own account, not to a bank.

### GET A TAX CREDIT WITH EACA

---

If you set up your Solo 401k with automatic contributions (Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement or EACA), you can get up to $1,500 in tax credits over three years.

How to claim this: File IRS Form 8881 when you do your taxes to take advantage of this credit.
