I'd like to gather feedback on the Estonian+UAE strategy for 0% tax discussed in this︋ thread:   
  
Essentially this works as following:  
  
Personal: you are a full UAE resident and️ tax resident.  
Corporate: you have an operating Estonian company ran & managed from the UAE.︅  
  
No Estonian dividends are declared. Profits are paid to you (shareholder) as salary only. This︊ salary isn't taxed in Estonia because you are a non-resident in Estonia on personal level.⁢  
UAE has no personal income tax so not taxed in UAE as well.  
  
Obviously, the⁠ amount of salary paid out needs to be aligned with the market, we're not talking︄ about a 200k EUR monthly salary here.  
  
Now, this Estonian company could be requalified as︈ UAE tax resident and pay 9% tax. That's fine, because a salary is a deductible︁ expense, one could pay a salary so that the Estonian company profit is below the︀ 375k AED threshold of UAE corporate tax, hence no corporate tax is paid in UAE.⁣  
  
Am I missing something or does this strategy work?

Just don't pay all the Estonia profit out as non-resident director salary in any year.︋ That would be an artificial construct for UAE purposes under GAAR designed to reduce the️ tax base of the Estonia company if company has a PE in UAE. I would︅ get professional tax advice before doing this or read the legislation carefully to see if︊ it affects you at all.

Since then on Dec 2022 they adopted⁢ GAAR under Decree︍ Law 47. See Article 50.....  
So basically any excessive salary will⁠ run foul of⁢ GAAR as an abusive practice designed to reduce your tax base under︄ Article 50. You may want to see what the penalties for doing so look like︈ in UAE before︌ trying your luck. And as KPMG says also below they closed doors︁ on those thinking to use multiple companies to stay below thresholds:  
"If a person with︀ total revenue of︅ more than AED 3 million artificially separates his/her business to claim benefits⁣ under Small Business︋ Relief, it will be considered an arrangement to obtain a Corporate Tax︆ advantage under the️ General Anti-Abuse Rules (GAAR) set out in Article 50 of the Corporate︍ Tax Law."  
Bottom line is UAE will NO longer be the wild west playground it︂ once was. As︁ I said ages ago on this forum the UAE is going to︇ change once OECD︃ get on them - which they have. What UAE wishes to do︌ tax wise is︉ irrelevant once OECD tell them what to do.  
The only thing I︃ underestimated is the︄ speed of the changes. But in a dictatorship changes can happen extremely︉ quickly as we︈ have seen. People just need to get their head around these tax⁤ changes and stop︆ thinking some Sheikh has your interests at heart.

No, it has always worked like this, and️ it's what has been used by pretty much all nomads since the early days of︅ e-residency.  
You don't need UAE residency for this. Estonia will not tax a salary paid︊ to non-residents where work is not performed locally. I'm not even sure if there are⁢ any countries that do. This is a very standard thing. You can achieve the same⁠ thing with a UK Ltd., for example.  
  
UAE residency only complicates things because you don't︄ know how the UAE will look at it.  
Besides, you can't just "get residency" in︈ the UAE. You will need to follow the correct processes.  
  
And the UAE has requirements︁ to register for tax, even if no tax is due.  
You can't just assume that︀ only because no tax would have to be paid, you are in the clear in⁣ the UAE. You would still be risking hefty fines.  
Then again - you could probably︆ even just use a US LLC as a UAE resident and fly under the radar.︍ It's not like they go after such setups at the moment.
