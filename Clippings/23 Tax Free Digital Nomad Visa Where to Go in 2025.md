What Else to Know about Visas for Digital Nomads

So, the choice is up to you: which place do you prefer? Of course, there are also other things to take into consideration than just the strength of the WiFi.

The first thing is cost of living. Some places, for example the UAE, might not charge you any income tax. Yet, the cost of living in this country is rather high.

Furthermore, many will look for a proper nomad or expat community to get that connection with fellow humans. This might be easier in some places and harder in others.

In any case, hopping from one tax free digital nomad visa to another can also be exhausting. Therefore, contact me if you want to figure out a long term solution for your tax strategy.
