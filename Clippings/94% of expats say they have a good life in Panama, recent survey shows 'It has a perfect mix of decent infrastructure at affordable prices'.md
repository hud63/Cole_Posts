For the second consecutive year, Panama is the best country for expats.

That’s according to a recent InterNations Expat Insider survey that considered 46 destinations around the globe, across five topical categories to determine the final ranking of the best countries in the world for expats in 2025.

The five categories are:

1. Working abroad
2. Personal finance
3. Quality of life
4. Expat essentials
5. Ease of settling in

InterNations surveyed 10,085 expats with a sample size of at least 50 participants per country. Participants were asked to rate up to 53 factors on a scale of one to seven.

Of the respondents, 35% are already retired and 18% say their primary motivation for moving was to retire there. In the quality of life ranking, Panama also ranked No. 3 and 35% of those surveyed there say they plan to stay in the country forever.

“It has a perfect mix of decent infrastructure at affordable prices in combination with a pleasant climate and most importantly, a culture that’s open, friendly and easy to integrate with,” Kathrin Chudoba, Chief Marketing Officer at InterNations, tells CNBC Make It.

Panama ranking at the very top of the list is part of an ongoing trend, Chudoba says. People looking to live and work abroad are having positive experiences in Asian and Latin American countries.

“This \[also\] confirms a trend that we have observed in the past three years or so and that’s the importance of personal finance amongst expats,” she adds. “It clearly shows that expats haven’t been left untouched by the effects of economic uncertainty and high inflation.”

Before moving to Panama, 26% of expats reported having no concerns, compared to 16% globally. The survey also found that for those expats who aren’t retired, the country offers an amazing experience working abroad, ranking No. 1 in the topical category.

Panama has long been known as an affordable destination for expats. For about $800 to $1,500 per month, you can live comfortably in small towns, villages and farming communities, according to the Global Citizen Solutions. Those looking to live in Panama City, the capital of Panama, will require a higher monthly budget of up to $2,500. The overall cost of living in Panama for a single person is 36.3% lower than in the U.S.

Like other countries, Panama offers expats several different visa options, including the Friendly Nations visa, the Pensionado (“Pensioner” in English) Program, and the Remote Worker visa.
