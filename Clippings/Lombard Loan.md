lets you borrow against a portfolio (stocks/bonds/funds)
Borrowing **does not** create a taxable capital gain
avoid realizing gains you‚Äôd otherwise trigger by selling
avoid potential capital gains taxes because you don‚Äôt have to sell securities for access to cash.
How the ‚Äúno taxes because it‚Äôs debt‚Äù idea really works

1. You **avoid** realizing gains when you borrow; 
2) you may or may not deduct the **interest** (depends on use and net investment income limits); 
3) some wealthy households pair borrowing with a **step-up in basis at death**, which can erase embedded gains for heirs

**No sale, no gain**: Borrowing against a portfolio does **not** realize capital gains
If you‚Äôre redomiciling the **business** (Cayman/BVI/Singapore/HK etc.)  
‚Äî **Feasibility:** Continuation/redomiciliation is routine in Cayman/BVI and increasingly supported in other hubs;
**Hold the portfolio in the borrowing entity** (or an SPV it owns) at the lending bank
‚Ä¢ If your **company (or SPV)** holds a portfolio, you can get Lombard financing against those **securities**‚Äînot against machinery/inventory (that‚Äôs ABL)
