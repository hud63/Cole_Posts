The reason why this happens is because unlike a business that's driven by results, not necessarily even logic, but results, they are not able to end up in places where they're this stupid. Governments, every second, every minute, of every hour, and every day, we compound that over time, they're not driven by results. You get to places like this where you need to prove that your ability to have income and at the same meeting say that you have no intention And the day this change will come later than the day the sun ceases to be hot enough to keep the planet warm.

### **Detailed Synopsis**

In this informative video, Alex Wittman addresses a recent and alarming trend: a growing number of Americans and Canadians are being denied temporary residency in Mexico, despite having flawless applications. The speaker reveals that the primary reason for these rejections stems from a critical misunderstanding of the visa's purpose. Applicants, often digital nomads or remote workers, honestly state their intention to work from Mexico during their consular interviews. However, the temporary resident visa is granted based on economic solvency—proof that the applicant can support themselves without needing to work. By stating an intent to work, applicants inadvertently signal to consular officers that they do not meet the foundational requirement of the visa they are applying for, leading to immediate denial. The video serves as a crucial guide, cautioning applicants to frame their intentions correctly by emphasizing their financial self-sufficiency and their desire to experience Mexican culture, rather than their plans to work remotely.

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

1. Introduction: The Emerging Problem

The video opens by highlighting that an increasing number of applicants for Mexican residency are being unexpectedly rejected. This is happening even to individuals who have meticulously prepared their paperwork and seemingly meet all the financial requirements. The central mystery the video aims to solve is why these well-prepared applications are suddenly being denied.

2. The Critical Mistake: Stating the Intent to Work

The speaker identifies the single biggest mistake leading to denial: telling the consular officer that you plan to work in Mexico. This includes working remotely for a foreign company. Many applicants, particularly digital nomads, assume that since their employer is not in Mexico, their work is irrelevant to the visa application. However, this is a critical error in judgment.

3. Understanding the Visa's Purpose

A key distinction is made between a "temporary resident visa" and a "work visa." The temporary resident visa, which is what most expats and remote workers apply for, is not a work permit. Its approval is based on demonstrating "economic solvency." This means the applicant must prove they have sufficient funds (through savings, investments, or a pension) to live in Mexico without needing to engage in lucrative activities within the country.

4. The Consular Officer's Point of View

From the perspective of the Mexican consulate, when an applicant says, "I plan to work remotely," the officer hears, "I need to work to support myself in Mexico." This statement directly contradicts the principle of economic solvency that the visa is built upon. The consulates are now cracking down on this, viewing it as an intention to violate the terms of the non-work-related residency permit.

5. How to Properly Frame Your Intentions

The video provides clear advice on how to navigate the consular interview successfully. When asked about your plans in Mexico, the correct approach is to focus on the reasons for moving that are unrelated to work.

- **Correct Answers:** You should state that you plan to immerse yourself in the culture, learn Spanish, travel within the country, take a sabbatical, or retire.
    
- **The Key Message:** The emphasis must be on your financial independence. The core of your argument should be that you have the means to support yourself entirely through your existing savings or passive income, which is what your financial documents are meant to prove. You are seeking residency to experience the country, not as a place to conduct work.
    

6. Conclusion and Final Advice

The speaker concludes by reiterating that while it feels counterintuitive to omit details about one's profession, it is essential for a successful application. The interview is not about your career; it is a verification of your financial ability to reside in Mexico without participating in its labor market. By understanding the true purpose of the temporary resident visa and framing your intentions accordingly, you can avoid the common pitfall that leads to denial.
