I live in Europe, and I’m an exec for US based tech company. For the company I act as contractor not employee.  
  
Through my long years of work, I accumulated private equity in the company through vesting over time. The company has healthy private equity⁠ market in terms of demand and planning to go public sometime in the next 12⁤ months.  
  
If I exercise the options and sell them (shares) while in Europe, I will⁣ pay third as taxes best case. Hence me wanting to move.  
  
I looked into UAE⁢ and Georgia, definitely good options, but also would like know what are other options for︀ me?  
  
For example, somehow I read Philippines has good tax scheme for money from foreign︁ sources and almost 0% on equities. Maybe HK and SG (or my fav: [Thailand](https://www.offshorecorptalk.com/threads/analyzing-asian-tax-in-some-of-the-most-popular-jurisdictions-among-entrepreneurs.37190/)) have︂ similar advantages too(?!)  
  
\- anybody looked into Philippines or other Asian countries for that matter?︃ Is my observation correct?  
\- is banking stable in Philippines or the country you may︄ propose? … equities worth 7-8 digits usd and wanna to make sure it will be︅ cashed out in a good stable environment.

Did you check the malta/cyprus non-dom regime?

Malaysia and Singapore are also options in SEA.  
Mauritius is also an option.  
Many countries also offer a foreign income tax exemption when relocating your tax residency (Israel, New Zealand, Chile etc..)  
Do you need certain DTA's?  
Are you just looking to⁠ "cash out " or really relocate and live there?

Main big question is if you actually can just leave as of now. I mean many countries would tax the options you receive at the time your receive them. And then if you have options and the country you are in has capital gains taxes,⁠ you may be subject to deemed disposal exit taxes too.  
  
Maybe Hong Kong would be⁤ an option to relocate. I mean pretty much any country without capital gains taxes would⁣ do the job? Or is there also an income part of the options as you⁢ technically do not even own the options nor the shares? In which case, you would︀ need a country which does not tax off-shore revenue either (Hong Kong again would qualify).︁ Also China and Japan would probably do the job as they do not tax your︂ off-shore earnings in the early years.

Great points guys, thanks for the input!  
  
Allow me to iterate and make it more specific:  
\- Yes, I will continue working on contractor basis and would need to receive a salary from abroad. Hence low-to-zero tax on foreign income is needed here too.  
\- Unfortunately I can’t work from Malysia, China, Indonesia, and a few other countries. But Philippines,⁠ HK, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, US, EU, and others- are fine.  
  
Follow up:  
\- does that⁤ still make Cyprus and Malta good options?  
\- anywhere in SEA too?  
\- how about⁣ Philippines or Thailand specifically?Are they a good option? Are banks stable to cash out 7-8⁢ digits usd?  
  
Thanks!

Hi for your︆ equity realization and long-term planning, Mauritius stands out as one of the best jurisdictions. While︇ UAE, Georgia, and parts of Asia (Philippines, Singapore, Thailand) have their merits, Mauritius offers a︈ unique balance of:  
- Tax efficiency with exemptions on foreign income,
- Stable, compliant banking,
- 40+ tax︉ treaties and strong reputation,
- Easy residency in a safe environment.
Given the size of your︊ equity, Mauritius offers low tax, reliable banking, and global credibility,making it a compelling choice.

I would certainly look into Cyprus.  
Unfortunately Mauritius is not an option.

The Problem is that Mauritius is that they⁢ actually enforce PE/CFC/POEM rules.  
That rules Maritius out for most people here.
