Looking to relocate to Italy without a job or business investment? Italy’s Residenza Elettiva visa offers one of the smoothest and most elegant ways to live long-term in the heart of Europe—if you have passive income and a desire for la dolce vita. In this article, we’ll break down who qualifies, what it costs, and how you can go from application to residency in as little as 6 months.

What Is the Italy Residenza Elettiva Visa?

Italy’s Elective Residence Visa is designed for financially independent individuals who want to move to Italy and enjoy a peaceful life—without working or running a business in the country.

It is ideal for:

Remote retirees
High-net-worth individuals
Digital nomads (with passive income)
Families seeking long-term European residence
No job required
No business activity
No minimum investment in real estate

You simply need to prove you can afford to live in Italy.

Main Requirements to Move to Italy

To qualify for the Italy Residenza Elettiva visa in 2025, you must meet the following criteria:

✔ Financial Independence  
– Minimum annual passive income of €30,960 – Acceptable sources: pensions, dividends, rental income, royalties, etc.  
– Employment income is not accepted

Add 100% of that amount for a spouse, and another 100% per child (50% for each additional child beyond 4).

✔ Accommodation in Italy  
– You must rent or purchase a place to live in Italy  
– Lease agreements must be 12–18 months minimum  
– The property value is not legally regulated

✔ Legal Documents  
– Valid passport  
– Background check (clean criminal record)  
– Proof of income and accommodation  
– Application submitted in your country of citizenship

What Are the Benefits of Italian Residency?

Visa-free travel across the EU/Schengen Zone
Bring your spouse, children, and even financially dependent parents
No minimum real estate investment required
Path to Permanent Residency after 5 years
Eligible for Italian citizenship after 5 years of residency
Live in one of the most culturally rich, safe, and scenic countries in the world

How Long Does It Take?

Can You Get Citizenship?

Yes. The Residenza Elettiva is a legal path to Italian citizenship.

After 5 years: Apply for permanent residence
After 5 years: Apply for citizenship (based on residency, not ancestry)
You must reside in Italy 183+ days per year to be eligible

Tax Benefits for the Wealthy

Italy offers a flat tax regime of €200,000/year for HNWIs who:

Have not been tax residents of Italy in the previous 9 years
Choose to relocate and bring foreign income
Want to be exempt from taxation on worldwide income for up to 15 years

Can You Work or Start a Business?

No. The Residenza Elettiva prohibits employment and business activity in Italy.

This makes it perfect for retirees or financially independent individuals—not active entrepreneurs.
