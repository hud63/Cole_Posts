For individuals across the globe, discovering British ancestry can pave the way to applying for British citizenship. Whether through a parent born in the United Kingdom, or even a grandparent, there may be a legal basis to obtain British citizenship and, ultimately, a British passport.

Interest in claiming British citizenship through ancestral lineage has increased in recent years, driven in part by shifting political landscapes around the world. For many, a UK passport represents stability, new opportunities and security.

But who qualifies for British citizenship by descent, and how can eligibility be assessed? Whilst British nationality law is highly complex and legal advice should always be sought, the key pathways and eligibility criteria are outlined below.

British Nationality Act 1981

The British Nationality Act 1981 introduced two main types of citizenship:

- - Citizenship otherwise than by descent.
		- Citizenship by descent.

The main difference between these categories lies in how citizenship is acquired and whether it can be passed on to children born outside of the UK.

What Is Citizenship Otherwise Than by Descent?

British citizenship otherwise than by descent can be generally passed on automatically to children born outside of the UK.

It applies to individuals who:

- - Have naturalised or registered as a British citizen
		- Were born in the UK prior to 1983 (with some very limited exceptions)
		- Were born in the UK to a British or settled parent after 1983

What Is Citizenship by Descent?

British citizenship by descent generally applies to individuals born outside of the UK who acquire citizenship through a British parent.

- - Rules differ based on the year of birth and the type of British citizenship the parent held at the time of the child’s birth.
		- In most cases, British citizenship can only be automatically passed down one generation to children born outside the UK.
		- Some individuals may still be eligible to register as British citizens if they fall outside of the rules relating to the automatic transmission of citizenship.

Key Paths Available for Applicants Born Outside the UK to a British Parent

The most common path to British citizenship through ancestry is being born abroad to a British citizen. Rights depend primarily on the date of birth.

Born before 1 January 1983

If born outside the UK before 1983, citizenship rights are based on whether the father was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) at the time of the applicant’s birth. This is a complex question, which requires full investigation.

Key conditions include:

- - The father must have been legally married to the mother at the time of birth.
		- He must have been born or adopted in the UK, naturalised before the applicant’s birth, or serving overseas as a Crown servant during the time of birth.

If these conditions are met, British citizenship may have been acquired automatically. If so, an application can be made for a British passport or a letter of confirmation of citizenship.

Born outside of the UK between 1 January 1983 and 30 June 2006

During this period, either parent could pass on British citizenship, but only if they were British citizens otherwise than by descent. This means the parent was born or adopted in the UK or naturalised as a British citizen in their own right. It does not include individuals who were themselves British citizens by descent, i.e., born overseas and obtained citizenship through a British parent.

Additional points to consider:

- - If the father was a British citizen and the mother was not, parents needed to be married at the time of birth for the citizenship to be automatically passed on.
		- If the parent was a British citizen by descent (e.g. also born abroad), or the British father was not married to the mother, citizenship could not normally be passed on automatically.
		- Provisions exist to register as a British citizen if:
			- - The father was British at the time of birth, but parents were unmarried
				- The child was raised in the UK for a portion of childhood
				- The parent was serving in the Crown service or armed forces

Born on or after 1 July 2006

Citizenship rules became more inclusive after this date. If either parent was a British citizen otherwise than by descent at the time of birth, and the child was born outside the UK, British citizenship by descent may have been automatically passed on.

However, as with earlier periods, a British citizen by descent typically cannot pass on citizenship to their children born outside the UK.

Can Citizenship be Claimed Through a Grandparent?

British citizenship does not usually pass on automatically to the grandchildren of British citizens. However, exceptions exist under Section 4L of the British Nationality Act, which introduces several ways to apply for British citizenship.

Common scenarios include:

- - Claims based on historic legislative unfairness such as laws preventing mothers from passing on citizenship or children being born to unmarried parents.
		- Cases where citizenship was wrongly denied due to acts or omissions of a public authority.
		- Truly exceptional circumstances presented to the Home Office for their consideration.

Each case is unique, and Fragomen can provide legal advice and expert assistance to explore these lesser-known pathways.

What if Citizenship by Ancestry Is Not an Option?

A wide range of UK visas are available for those not eligible through ancestry. Many of these visas provide the opportunity to apply for British citizenship after a qualifying residence period in the UK.
