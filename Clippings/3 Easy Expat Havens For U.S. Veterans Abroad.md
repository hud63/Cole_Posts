According to the latest figures from the Census Bureau, 15.8 million people—some 6.1% of the adult American population—are Veterans. Almost half are aged 65 and over while many others are not yet of retirement age but are retired from the military.

The Veteran’s Association (VA) states that, as a Veteran, you are entitled to the benefits and services you earned through your military service no matter where in the world you live. And when it comes to health care, a host of overseas destinations take TRICARE, CHAMPVA, and treat veterans through the Foreign Medical Program of the VA for service-connected treatments.

Other attractions to a fresh start overseas include a lower cost of living, better weather, the opportunity to meet new people, learn a new language, experience a new culture, and enjoy a new adventure.

Here’s a look at three places that make sense for Veterans looking to relocate abroad.

Thailand

Retired Veteran John H. Davis, an author, veteran advocate and co-founder of Veterans in Paradise says, “Thailand stands out for Veterans keen to prioritize mental and physical health. Veterans feel welcomed and respected in Thailand, a nation that deeply reveres its elders. Thai culture encourages patience and compassion which can be great for Veterans coming from the high stress environment of the military.

“Adding to Thailand’s appeal is that it boasts many different Veterans of Foreign Wars posts (VFW) and American Legions. The posts give back to the local community and help Veterans with specific health care, billing, and the foreign medical program of the VA.”

Thailand offers several paths to residency. For retirees, the most straightforward is the Non-Immigrant O-A Visa. The basic requirement is that you are at least 50 years old, have adequate health insurance, and meet the financial requirements which can be least 800,000 THB (about $25k) in deposits, or a monthly income of at least 65,000 THB (about $2k), or a combination of both.

Thailand also offers some of the best beaches and cuisine in the world, a raft of entertainment and lifestyle options, an affordable cost of living,—a monthly budget of $2,000 will buy you a comfortable lifestyle here—and foreigner-friendly infrastructure.

Popular spots for expats include Koh Samui, Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Hua Hin. Due to their thriving expat communities and popularity with tourists you’ll find you can get by in English easily in these welcoming spots.

Germany

The U.S. Army, Air Force, Marines, and Special Operations Command all have a presence in Germany making it familiar territory for many Veterans. Active bases offer facilities including Post Exchanges (PX), commissary, and health services.

You’ll find VFW posts in Wiesbaden, Kitzingen, Berlin, Illesheim, and beyond as well as the largest American Legion Post in Europe, housed in Stuttgart. Other popular areas for Veterans include Ramstein, Kaiserslautern, Munich, and Heidelberg.

With a robust economy, beautiful and diverse landscape, excellent education and health care facilities, and a strong job market, Germany has much to offer expats. Many of the locals speak English and around military bases you’ll find large communities you can plug into easily. A monthly budget of $3,500 is a good general guide. As anywhere, life in the big cities comes at a higher cost.

Germany offers several visa options for Americans including an Employment Visa for those with a job offer from a German employer and a Job Seeker Visa for those looking for work. Germany does not have a dedicated retirement visa so those looking to retire here generally apply under residence permits for “other purposes”. Applicants will need to show proof of long-term financial security and valid health insurance to qualify.

Costa Rica

For Veterans seeking beautiful scenery, established expat communities, and generous residency and tax policies, you’ll find them all in Costa Rica.

Costa Rica’s Pensionado visa has one of the lowest financial requirements in the world—$1,000 a month. However, living there will cost you a good deal more. Budget at least $3,000 a month for a comfortable life in the country’s expat havens such as Tamarindo, Atenas, and Dominical.

The Pensionado visa also allows holders to import household goods and vehicles duty-free and register with Costa Rica’s public health care system (Caja). After three years of temporary residency, you can apply for permanent residency.

“Costa Rica is an interesting option for Veterans because it’s one of the few nations without a standing military,” says John. “In 1948, the country made a unique decision to abolish its military and redirect those funds to health care, education, and infrastructure. This move greatly shaped the national identity and today it’s one of the most peaceful and stable nations in Latin America.

“When you touch down in Costa Rica, you’ll hear “Pura Vida” constantly— it translates to “pure life” but it’s really a mindset. It emphasizes enjoying the present moment and gratitude. For Veterans seeking to make the most of their time in nature, enjoying adventure activities, and living the good life Costa Rica is a great option.”
