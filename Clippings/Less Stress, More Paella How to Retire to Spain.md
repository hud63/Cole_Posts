Friendly, welcoming locals. Great food. A comfortable climate essentially everywhere in the country. A reasonable cost of living, and a world-class healthcare system. There are countless reasons Spain is a popular retirement destination, coming in at #6 on International Living’s list of Top 10 Retirement Destinations for 2025 and at #11 on Cigna Healthcare’s list, which cites all those factors as well as Spain’s arts and culture and its non-lucrative visa as reasons for its popularity.

But the why of retiring to Spain is easy. The how takes some preparation. So go ahead and download Duolingo (or your language-learning app of choice — speaking Spanish in Spain will enrich your experience) and start gathering your documents to make your move.

The Non-Lucrative Visa

Spain’s non-lucrative visa (NLV) is the visa of choice for retirees who plan to live in Spain without working. So retirees, people with passive income, and independently wealthy people can all come and stay using the NLV, as long as they meet all the other criteria. Specifically:

Proof of income. As of 2025, you’re required to show a minimum of about €2,400/month (around $2,600 USD).
Private health insurance. Holders of the NLV aren’t eligible for Spain’s public health system (until you get permanent residency or citizenship), so you’ll still need private coverage.
Criminal background check
Medical certificate
Proof of unemployment. If you’re below Spain’s retirement age of 66, you’ll need a termination letter from your most recent employer or, if you’re self-employed, an affidavit promising you won’t work while you’re living in Spain.

You can also bring your spouse or partner and your dependent children (and/or parents) under your NLV, but you’ll have to provide evidence of additional income for each dependent.

The one-year NLV can be renewed for up to five years of residency, at which point you can apply for permanent residency and, eventually, citizenship.

Acquiring your NLV

You’ll apply for your NLV through your nearest Spanish consulate. Depending on the consulate, you may or may not have to schedule an appointment, and then show up with your application and necessary paperwork (Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides a full list of requirements). Typically, you’ll receive your visa within three months, at which point you can make your big trip.

Once you arrive, you’ll have 30 days to register for your residence card. When you have that, you can head to your nearest police station to apply for your NIE (your national identity number), which you’ll need for things like opening a bank account, buying a house, and joining Spain’s nationalized medical insurance program, if you choose to.

Living as a Retiree in Spain

While Spain’s cost of living is far more reasonable compared to that in the U.S., it still varies depending on where and how you plan to live. A comfortable lifestyle in Barcelona could cost you $4,000 a month, whereas you might be able to live modestly for $1,000 per person in Málaga (one of Expatsi’s cheapest retirement cities in the world).

Most American expats live in Madrid or Barcelona, but you’ll have a wide range of options based on your preferred weather, geography, and pace of life. That said, only 28% of Spanish people speak English fluently, and you’re more likely to find them in larger cities (or Costa Blanca towns like Benidorm). It’s a good idea to start learning Spanish now, not just for ease of living but also for making friends and becoming a part of your new community.

Until you’re eligible for permanent residence in Spain, your healthcare will be covered by your private insurance (or you can sign up for Spain’s nationalized medical insurance). Even without the public system, your private insurance is likely to be far more affordable than in the U.S., and you’ll have access to modern, well-equipped facilities and qualified providers.

“Spain is a good place to get old,” says Expatsi partner Alastair, half of “Al and Alison” and cofounder of Moving to Spain. “Older people are recognized as part of the community, not just shuffled into retirement homes and put out to pasture,” often integrated into multigenerational families and holding a respected place in society. Combine that with great healthcare and a reasonable cost of living, he says, and you have an attractive destination for your retirement years.

End-of-Life Care

While it’s not the most fun part of planning your retirement abroad, it’s important to know that if your health needs change, you won’t be left scrambling for support — and if you plan for Spain to be the last place you ever live, end-of-life care will probably be one of those health needs.

Spain launched a National Plan for Palliative Care in 2007 to improve the quality of end-of-life care nationwide, but implementation has been uneven across regions — it’s something you’ll want to research as you decide where in Spain to settle down. That said, most hospitals in Spain offer palliative care, and most of Spain has access to palliative care services, even if they’re not necessarily provided by a specialist. Most at-home services aren’t covered by Spain’s national health services, so if that’s a priority for you, be sure to secure private insurance that factors it in.

It’s also worth creating an advance directive (also known as a living will), so your wishes are known and respected, even if the rest of your family is far away. You can make yours at the same time you’re writing or translating your regular will and then register it with your regional government.

No one likes thinking about the end of life just as you’re launching off into the next stage of it. But making your plans now makes it that much easier to enjoy the great weather, culture, views, and easy living that inspired you to choose Spain in the first place.
