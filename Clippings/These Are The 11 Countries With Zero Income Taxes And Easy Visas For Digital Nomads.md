Working without borders provides freedom, more sunshine, more adventures, and financial breathing room outside the usual backbreaking 9-to-5 work. The "work anywhere" in the world and "work at your own pace" have been a household name among remote workers, or the digital nomads, for that matter, who are chasing the best of both worlds. Today, many countries have joined the bandwagon of welcoming digital nomads, offering visas to those who want to stay in their countries for a period of time. But what makes it even more interesting is that many countries have zero income tax, perfect for digital nomads seeking to enjoy their financial freedom.

[What is a digital nomad](https://www.thetravel.com/what-is-a-digital-nomad/)? And why have many people started to master the art of remote work? For the most sensible way of saying it, digital nomads are those who work remotely while traveling, thanks to the advancement of technology. Globetrotters are those who find comfort in remote work, as they get the chance to travel while working from their laptops at their own pace — no daily commutes and definitely no road traffic to dodge.

However, it's also important that while you're enjoying your nomadic lifestyle, you also make the most of your financial freedom. Income taxes can cause financial restraints, and, as a digital nomad, budgeting is crucial because you will have to look out for your expenses, especially for accommodation and food. If you're looking for your next big step, these countries are tax-free havens, making your dream of working globally to see the world.

Starting with the Bahamas! Not only is the Bahamas the ultimateisland life, but it is also a haven for digital nomads, allowing remote workers and even students to live in a tax-free Caribbean living for up to a year through the Bahamas Extended Access Travel Stay (BEATS), a one-year residency permit for students and digital nomads, which can be renewed after it expires.

The Bahamas doesn't have income tax, inheritance tax or company tax, or capital gains tax, making it a tax haven.

## 10 Panama

Casco Viejo, Panama City, Panama

Revered for its gorgeous beaches, great weather, quality of life, and vibrant festivals, Panama is another tax haven, one of the oldest and best-known in the Caribbean. It's been known for its tax avoidance since the early 20th century and did not cooperate with international tax transparency efforts until 2016, when it finally agreed to enhanced transparency.

Panama has a territorial tax system, which means that foreign workers who work for a foreign company are excluded from local income tax in Panama. Digital nomads can apply for a digital nomad visa, which is valid for nine months and can be extended up to the same period.

## 9 Costa Rica
