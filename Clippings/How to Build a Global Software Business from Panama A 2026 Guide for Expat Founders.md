The Expat Question: “How Do You Make Your Money?”

When you land in Panama—whether for retirement or a fresh start—sooner or later you’ll hear it: “What do you do for money here?”  
It’s the question that dominates Facebook expat groups, late-night dinners, and coffee chats from El Cangrejo to groups walking on the Cinta Costera.

For many, the answer is a gamble: working for less, operating in gray markets, or just hoping that pension stretches. But there’s another path—one that lets you set your own rules and earn on a global scale.

Why Panama Expats Should Think Like Entrepreneurs (Not Employees)

Let’s be real:

Wages in Panama don’t match what you’re used to.
Most good jobs are reserved for Panamanian citizens.
Work permits? Complicated, slow, and sometimes a dead end.

But here’s the opportunity:  
Panama wants foreign investment—especially from business owners. Special visa programs (like the Qualified Investor Visa) encourage you to launch a business, not just find a job.

And if you’re building a business that serves global clients (think: software, consulting, SaaS, online services), you get the best of both worlds:

Tax advantages under Panama’s territorial tax system (only local income is taxed). Or set up your business in the EU for true global acceptance. We can show you how.
Global mobility —your income follows you, not your passport.
Potential U.S. tax breaks if you set up your affairs smartly (consult your tax advisor for the FEIE and bona fide residence rules).

Panama’s startup ecosystem is evolving fast, giving expat entrepreneurs and small business owners access to resources, mentorship, and emerging digital infrastructure.

Panama Is Investing in Its Entrepreneurs

There’s real momentum behind this shift. President José Raúl Mulino recently announced a $150 million Guarantee Fund for SMEs, created with the National Bank of Panama, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

The program will guarantee up to 50% of loans up to $600,000 and could expand to $900 million. For founders, that’s a clear signal to move from ideas to plans: governments can fund capital, but they can’t replace strategy. A solid business plan is what turns policy support into real income.

If you’ve ever dreamed of turning your expertise into a global SaaS, there ’ s never been a better moment to start — with clarity and proof.

Validate Before You Build

This is where so many entrepreneurs burn money and time “vibe coding”—launching apps no one wants and they can’t sustain. What if you could test your idea, find your market, and know it’s worth pursuing—before you hire a developer or buy a domain? What if you could be certain of buyer signals before you invest in the next idea?

That’s what we do at PivotReady.

We focus on non-technical founders who want a business that they, or their family, can manage from anywhere in the world. Our validation tool, ViRA, gives you data-driven answers about market demand, pricing, and product positioning. Founders are already pressure-testing ideas at hackathons using ViRA—then pre-selling the winners before any code. No more guessing, no more wasting time or cash on ideas that won’t fly.
