Sicily has long captivated those dreaming of a life in the Mediterranean. With its stunning coastline, historic towns, exceptional food and wine, and a pace of life that balances tradition with modern comforts, the island already ranks high among lifestyle destinations in Italy. Now, a new measure by the Italian Government could make relocating here even more appealing: special tax incentives for individuals and businesses that move to Sicily.

For foreigners considering buying property, retiring, or investing on the island, these incentives may soon open the door to an even more rewarding move.

Why consider Sicily for relocation?

Sicily offers a combination of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and affordability that is hard to match elsewhere in Italy. Property prices remain significantly lower than in Tuscany, Rome or Milan, while the quality of life is enhanced by the island’s warm climate and welcoming communities.

With the upcoming tax breaks, there will be not only lifestyle advantages but also financial benefits for those choosing to make Sicily their home.

What the new decree means

The Italian Government has approved a new Legislative Decree that will allow Sicily, as a special-autonomy region, to introduce its own tax benefits. The aim is clear: attract new residents, support local businesses, and revitalise smaller towns at risk of depopulation.

In practice, this means that Sicily will be able to reduce or even eliminate certain local taxes, making life on the island more affordable for both new residents and investors.

Possible incentives for new residents and investors

While the exact measures have not yet been finalised, the Sicilian Government has already indicated several directions:

Lower personal income tax: The regional surcharge (currently 1.23%) could be reduced or abolished.
Business-friendly taxation: Adjustments to corporate tax rates (IRAP), currently close to 5%, to encourage start-ups and investment.
Support for property buyers: Tax incentives are expected for those purchasing and restoring homes, particularly in underpopulated areas.
Special benefits for retirees: Following the example of Portugal, foreign pensioners who move their residency to Sicily could enjoy reduced tax rates when purchasing property.

These incentives could be particularly interesting for retirees seeking a Mediterranean lifestyle, digital nomads working remotely, or investors looking at Sicily’s growing real estate market.

Inspired by the Portuguese model

Portugal famously attracted thousands of foreign residents between 2009 and 2023 thanks to its “Non-Habitual Resident” tax regime, which offered lower taxes on pensions, reduced rates for certain professions, and exemptions on some foreign income.

Sicily now aims to replicate that success, positioning itself as a competitive destination for expats, investors, and retirees in Europe.

What this means if you’re considering buying property in Sicily

For foreigners, this is an exciting time to look at the Sicilian property market. Lower taxes combined with already affordable house prices could make buying a villa by the sea, a townhouse in a baroque city, or a countryside farmhouse more attractive than ever.

Whether you are planning to retire, move your family, or invest in rental property, Sicily’s upcoming tax reforms could add real financial advantages to the island’s already irresistible lifestyle.

In short: Sicily is positioning itself as one of Europe’s most promising destinations for relocation and investment. If you’ve been considering making the move, this could be the ideal moment to explore the real estate opportunities the island has to offer.
