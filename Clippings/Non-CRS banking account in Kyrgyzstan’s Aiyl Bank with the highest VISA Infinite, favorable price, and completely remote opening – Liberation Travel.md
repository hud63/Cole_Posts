Currently, until the end of the year, with a special bonus — a one-year VISA Infinite subscription!

After many months, we have managed to fine-tune the opening of a non-CRS bank account at Aiyl Bank in Kyrgyzstan, with a special bonus until the end of the year — a one-year subscription to the highest VISA Infinite card, at a favorable price of EUR 1,337, and with the entire account opening process available remotely.

5 reasons why you want a non-CRS bank account in Kyrgyzstan

1\. Kyrgyzstan has not signed and does not plan to sign the CRS, and does not perform automated reporting

Unlike most countries, Kyrgyzstan has not joined (and does not plan to join) the global CRS spying cartel (which includes all EU countries). This means that Kyrgyz banks do not send automated information about account holders outside the country (as most banks worldwide do).

Paraguay has not signed the CRS either, but there are the following problems you will face if you want a full-fledged bank account in Paraguay:

1. To open a bank account in Paraguay, you need temporary or permanent residence in Paraguay (we are happy to help you with this).
2. To open a full-fledged Paraguayan bank account (without limits), you must declare local Paraguayan income, which is also taxed. Without local Paraguayan income, you can only open a basic bank account in Paraguay with a monthly limit of USD 1,000 (I recommend Banco Familiar, ITAÚ, or UENO).
3. To apply for a USD account or a better VISA/Mastercard card at a Paraguayan bank, you must be a solvent client with a sufficiently high (declared) income.

However, you can only dream of a EURO account at a Paraguayan bank.

You don’t have to face any of these problems if you decide to open a non-CRS bank account with the Kyrgyz bank Bakai or Aiyl, where we can open an account for you remotely — you don’t need any connection to Kyrgyzstan, nor any local income. You can get a full-fledged account without any restrictions.

2\. You do not need residency in the country or any other connection to open a bank account in Kyrgyzstan

In most countries around the world, you need either local residency or other connections, such as an employment contract, studies, or other ties, to open a bank account. This applies to all EU countries and almost all Latin American countries, including Paraguay and Uruguay. As an EU citizen, most banks in the EU will not open a bank account for you because you do not have residency in the given EU country (fortunately, I do not need an EU bank account because I have a better one

An exception is Georgia, for example, where you do not need local residence or any connection to Georgia to use Georgian banking services. Unfortunately, Georgia has signed the CRS agreement and has thus become a member of the global spying cartel with automatic reporting. If you are not a lucky tax resident in a non-CRS country, such as Paraguay, and you do not have a Georgian bank account opened in your tax residence in a non-CRS country (which we will be happy to help you with), then expect that it is only a matter of time before your Georgian bank reports you to your tax residence.

3\. Multi-currency account (USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, AMD, AZN, GEL, KGS, KZT, KRW, TRY, RUB, AED, and CNY)

Aiyl Bank allows you to easily open a bank account (with one click in their mobile app) in the following currencies:

USD — US dollar
EUR — Euro
GBP — British pound
CHF — Swiss franc
AMD — Armenian dram
AZN — Azerbaijani manat
GEL — Georgian lari
KGS — Kyrgyz som
KZT — Kazakh tenge
KRW — South Korean won
TRY — Turkish lira
RUB — Russian ruble
AED — United Arab Emirates dirham
CNY — Chinese yuan

You can receive foreign transfers directly in all of these currencies.

To receive EURO transactions, you can use the correspondent bank Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Germany (SOLADEST).

You can also top up your VISA card via IBAN through the correspondent bank JSC Haly Bank in Kazakhstan.

International transfers take a few days, but all of them arrived without any problems.

4\. Elite VISA Infinite card

What surprised me most about the Aiyl bank account is the elite VISA Infinite card, which you get for USD 150/year (as part of our promotion, you get the first year free). The card is valid for 5 years.

When ordering this card, you can choose USD, EUR, or KGS. The price of this card includes:

ATM withdrawals — 0.5% fee for EUR, 0.4% for USD. Payments in EUR/USD are free of charge. Complete price list of services here.

5\. Crypto-friendly

Kyrgyzstan does not have as developed a crypto infrastructure as Georgia. Here are ways (these options will likely expand in the future) to send crypto to your Kyrgyz bank account through:

1. Our Signal group, P2P Crypto Exchange for Kyrgyzstan users, where we voluntarily connect our clients who have accounts with Kyrgyz banks and want to trade crypto. They conduct P2P crypto transactions while clearing fiat through their EUR/USD account at a Kyrgyz bank. This is probably the safest and most advantageous way to trade crypto.
2. Binance P2P, which works reliably and quickly within a few minutes. Current offers to sell USDT for KGS can be found here.
3. CoinX is a local crypto exchange that operates in only one direction (from fiat at a Kyrgyz bank to crypto).

The special price of EUR 1337 includes:

1. Complete preparation of the power of attorney and its legalization/apostille.
2. Delivery of the apostilled power of attorney by courier to Kyrgyzstan.
3. Certified translation of the power of attorney into Kyrgyz.
4. Based on the power of attorney, purchase of a Kyrgyz SIM card from the provider Mega24 — a Kyrgyz local number linked to a bank account (the SIM card only needs to be topped up with a minimum amount once a month from your Kyrgyz account — you will receive detailed instructions from us).
5. Opening a bank account based on a power of attorney.
6. Application for and collection of a VISA Infinite card.
7. Sending a VISA Infinite card + Kyrgyz SIM card by DHL to your address anywhere in the world.
8. Sending the necessary instructions on how to log in and use Internet Banking.
9. In addition to our Kyrgyz Signal groups, where you can do P2P crypto trading.
10. One-year subscription to the VISA Infinite card (usually costs $150) and a minimum deposit of $150/€150.

What do I need to open an account?

We will open a bank account for you at Aiyl Bank, either in person or remotely, upon receipt of an apostilled power of attorney and a copy of your passport.

We have tested both regional and international apostilization. We need from you:

1. Your billing information (name, address) and preferred payment method (any cryptocurrency, transfer to a Kyrgyz account).
2. A scan of your passport and temporary/permanent residence address, based on which we will prepare the necessary power of attorney (which we will then apostille after your signature).
3. Your Signal number—we will create a separate Signal group where we will guide you through the entire account opening process.
4. What primary currency do you want for your VISA Infinite card (EUR or USD)?
5. The delivery address where you want your VISA Infinite card + Kyrgyz SIM card delivered (plus email and phone contact for the DHL courier).

Just send all this information to info@liberation.travel (the address runs on ProtonMail, or you can use our PGP key).

Is it possible to open a corporate account with Aiyl Bank in Kyrgyzstan?

Yes, it is possible, though a bit bureaucratic. Aiyl Bank needs the following information about your company. If you provide us with this information, we can try to open a corporate account for your foreign company.
