## Framework Post

Italy's flat tax regime is changing global wealth planning forever.

3,600 millionaires moved there in 2025 alone.

They discovered something most ultra-wealthy families miss.

A predictable €200,000 annual tax cap on all foreign income.

Here's the framework that's transforming wealth strategies:

**The Italian Advantage Framework**

Step 1: Establish Italian residency under the flat tax regime.

This requires not being an Italian resident for 9 of the previous 10 years.

- €200,000 fixed annual tax on foreign income
- €25,000 additional for each family member
- Valid for up to 15 years

Step 2: Position your family office in a strategic jurisdiction.

Keep wealth structures offshore while enjoying Italian residency.

- Singapore for Asian investment reach
- Switzerland for stability and prestige
- Luxembourg for flexible fund structures

Step 3: Optimize succession planning during the regime period.

Foreign assets are exempt from Italian gift and inheritance taxes.

- Transfer wealth between generations tax-efficiently
- Reorganize global holdings without additional taxation
- Align family governance with Italian civil law

**The winning combination creates predictability and growth.**

Italian lifestyle with global wealth optimization.

What's your biggest challenge with international tax planning?

## Story Post

Five years ago, I watched a wealthy family pay €2 million in taxes.

They had global assets generating massive returns.

Multiple jurisdictions meant multiple tax obligations.

Their wealth advisor mentioned Italy's flat tax regime.

Here's what happened next:

They relocated from London to Tuscany in 2024.

Their tax bill dropped to €200,000 annually.

Same global portfolio. Same returns. Different residency.

Their family office remained in Singapore.

This preserved their Asian investment strategies.

Meanwhile, they enjoyed Italian culture and lifestyle.

**But the real transformation came in year two.**

They reorganized their entire wealth structure.

Transferred assets to their children tax-free.

Italian law exempted foreign assets from gift taxes.

What once cost millions now cost nothing.

**The family office continued managing €50 million abroad.**

Zero Italian taxation on foreign growth.

Predictable €200,000 annual charge regardless of returns.

15-year certainty for long-term planning.

**Today, they call Italy their wealth optimization hub.**

Not just a vacation destination.

A cornerstone of their global strategy.
