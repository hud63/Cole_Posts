ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Court Case Citizenship: Skip the Consulate NightmareÂ Â 

Italy is offering citizenship through court cases and it's a game-changer for those stuck in appointment hell because you don't need a consulate appointment to qualify and the entire process is handled electronically from anywhere in the world. Your attorney files everything remotely, represents you at the hearing, and the court grants citizenship directlyâ€”no consulate involvement whatsoever. This guide goes step by step through the electronic filing process, hearing procedures, and timeline expectations.Â Â 

Large families can file together on one case, saving thousands. The average timeline is 9-12 months from filing to hearing, then 2-6 weeks for a decision. After 60 days, you register with AIRE and get your Italian passport.Â Â 

This is the alternative path when consulates fail you.

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy Grants Citizenship Through Court - No Consulate Appointment NeededÂ Â 

Italy's court system offers a direct path to citizenship that bypasses the impossible consulate appointment system entirely. The court has the legal power to grant citizenship directly without forcing you through the consulate process.Â Â 

You can file electronically from anywhere in the world. No need to travel to Italy for hearings. Cases typically resolve in 9-12 months with a decision rendered 2-6 weeks after the hearing.Â Â 

The â‚¬600 filing fee per person is a small price for EU citizenship when consulate appointments are impossible to secure for years.Â Â 

Large families can file together on one case, sharing attorney fees and common documents. The court decides directly whether you're a citizen - it's that simple.Â Â 

This guide goes step by step through the process of actually applying through the Italian court system. Stop waiting for that consulate appointment that will never come.
