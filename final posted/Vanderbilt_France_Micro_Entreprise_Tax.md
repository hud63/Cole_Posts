🇫🇷 Live in France. Pay only 13% effective income tax. 100% legal.

Most people think France's 45% income tax makes it impossible for freelancers. They're wrong.

The micro-entreprise regime is France's secret weapon for service-based freelancers earning under €77,000.

Here's the math:
✅ Automatic 34% cost deduction on turnover
✅ Only 66% of earnings are taxed
✅ Flat 21.20% social contribution rate
✅ Combined effective rate: ~13% total

Example: €60,000 revenue = €39,600 taxable income

No complex structures. No offshore accounts. Just straightforward French tax law working in your favor.

The French lifestyle without the French tax burden.
