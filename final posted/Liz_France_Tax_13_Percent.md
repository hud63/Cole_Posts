Everyone thinks France is a tax nightmare for freelancers.

They're not wrong about the rates—45% income tax plus up to 45% social contributions.

But they ARE wrong about the options.

👉 The micro-entreprise regime lets service freelancers earning under €77K pay an effective 13% tax rate

👉 You get an automatic 34% cost deduction—no receipts, no headaches

👉 Flat 21.20% social contribution rate instead of the nightmare bracket system

👉 You're only taxed on 66% of what you actually earn

Example: €60K revenue = €39,600 taxable income.

No offshore structures. No creative accounting. Just straightforward French tax law that nobody talks about because it doesn't fit the narrative.

The dream of living in France isn't financially insane.

You just need to know which door to walk through.

The micro-entreprise regime is that door.
