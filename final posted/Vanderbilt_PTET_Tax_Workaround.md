🇺🇸 California & New York Business Owners: Save $25K+ in Taxes Using PTET

Business owners in high-tax states can now deduct their ENTIRE state tax bill from federal returns using the Pass-Through Entity Tax workaround.

While W-2 employees are capped at a $10,000 SALT deduction,
S-Corps and partnerships can deduct $100,000+
by paying state taxes through their business entity.

Same income,
$25,000+ less in federal taxes annually.

Connecticut pioneered this in 2018,
the IRS approved it in 2020,
and now virtually every state offers it.

The catch?
You need a pass-through entity (S-Corp or partnership),
not a C-Corp.

Deadlines vary wildly by state:
New York's deadline is March 15,
California's is June 15,
New Jersey gets until March 2026.

This guide breaks down eligibility, election deadlines, and filing requirements state by state.

If you're earning $500K+,
this can put an extra $30K in your pocket every year.
