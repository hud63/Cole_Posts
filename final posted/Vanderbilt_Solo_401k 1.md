🇺🇸 The Solo 401k: America's Most Powerful Tax-Advantaged Retirement Account

If you have ANY self-employment income—even a few dollars from social media—you qualify.

Up to $70,000 per year in tax-deferred contributions.
$150,000 for married couples working together.

No full-time employees required.
No business entity needed.

The flexibility is extraordinary:
• Pre-tax AND Roth contributions
• Borrow up to $50,000 anytime, for any reason
• Invest in almost any asset (stocks, crypto, real estate)
• Mega Backdoor Roth access

Most people miss this: even with a full-time W-2 job, your side hustle income qualifies you for a separate Solo 401k.

You can max out BOTH your employer 401k AND your Solo 401k in the same year.

Setup deadline: December 31.
Contribution deadline: Tax filing date.

The complete guide breaks down eligibility rules, contribution limits, and provider comparisons.

$1,500 tax credit just for setting it up.
