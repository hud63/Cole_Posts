🇮🇪 🇮🇹 🇵🇱 🇵🇹 🇬🇧 Could You Already Be a Dual Citizen?

Millions worldwide qualify for EU citizenship through ancestry and don't even know it. Citizenship by descent programs grant you the same rights as a native citizen without expensive investment schemes or language barriers.

Ireland grants citizenship to great-grandchildren if parents registered before your birth—triple descent is exceptionally rare. Poland technically considers descendants of Polish citizens as already Polish, requiring only "Confirmation of Citizenship" paperwork. Portugal offers citizenship to grandchildren who demonstrate basic Portuguese knowledge. The UK provides a five-year ancestry visa for Commonwealth citizens with UK-born grandparents, leading to full citizenship.

Even Germany, Austria, and Romania extend citizenship to descendants of Nazi regime victims, recognizing historical injustices with modern pathways.

83 million people worldwide are eligible for Italian citizenship alone. An estimated 80 million have Irish descent claims. Instead of paying €700,000 for Malta's investment citizenship, check your family tree. You might already own an EU passport.
