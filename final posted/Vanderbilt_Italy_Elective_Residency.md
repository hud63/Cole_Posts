🇮🇹 Move to Italy With Zero Investment Required: The Residenza Elettiva

Italy's Elective Residency Visa is the golden ticket to European living because you don't need a job, business, or real estate investment to qualify.

Just prove €30,960 annual passive income.
Pensions, dividends, rental income—all accepted.
Employment income? Not allowed.

No minimum real estate purchase required,
just a 12-18 month lease agreement.

After 5 years:
Permanent residency.
Italian citizenship eligibility.
Full EU access.

HNWIs get a €200,000/year flat tax option,
exempting worldwide income for up to 15 years.

The catch?
You cannot work or run a business in Italy.

This makes it perfect for retirees,
remote earners with passive income,
and anyone seeking la dolce vita without the hustle.

Comment "ELECTIVE" for the guide that breaks down the step-by-step application process, timeline, and tax benefits. From application to residency in as little as 6 months.
