🇮🇹 Sicily just became one of Europe's most attractive relocation destinations.

The Italian Government approved a new Legislative Decree allowing Sicily to offer special tax incentives for foreign residents and investors - similar to Portugal's famous "Non-Habitual Resident" program that attracted thousands between 2009-2023.

What's on the table:
• Regional income tax reduced/eliminated (currently 1.23%)
• Corporate tax rate adjustments (IRAP near 5%)
• Property purchase incentives, especially in underpopulated areas
• Special benefits for foreign retirees relocating their residency

Combine these upcoming tax breaks with Sicily's already affordable property prices (far below Rome, Milan, or Tuscany), stunning Mediterranean coastline, and exceptional quality of life
...this could be the opportunity of the decade.

The exact measures will be finalized soon
but the direction is clear:
Sicily wants you there.

Our complete guide on Sicily's new tax regime and property investment opportunities is coming soon. This is the moment to explore what the island has to offer.
