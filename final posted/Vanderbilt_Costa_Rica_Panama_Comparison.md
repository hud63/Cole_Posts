🇨🇷🇵🇦 Costa Rica vs Panama: Which tropical paradise is right for YOUR retirement?

Both nations offer stunning natural beauty, warm climates, and thriving expat communities. But there are key differences:

Panama wins on affordability. Outside Panama City, you'll find lower housing costs, cheaper utilities, and reasonable grocery prices. Plus, their Friendly Nations visa offers a fast track to residency for U.S. citizens.

Costa Rica counters with its legendary "Pura Vida" lifestyle and mandatory public healthcare enrollment for residents. This gives you access to quality care at little to no additional cost beyond monthly fees.

The real winner? Panama for ease of residency (Pensionado visa + Friendly Nations pathway) and lower cost of living. Costa Rica for laid-back culture and guaranteed healthcare access.

Both offer Pensionado visas for retirees and high-quality private healthcare at prices that shame U.S. costs.
