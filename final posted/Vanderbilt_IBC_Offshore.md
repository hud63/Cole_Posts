🏝️ 0% Corporate Tax for a Few Hundred Dollars: The IBC Advantage

Traditional offshore jurisdictions like the Bahamas and Seychelles offer International Business Companies (IBCs) that pay zero corporate tax on foreign income.

The setup cost?
A few hundred dollars.

Annual maintenance?
A few hundred dollars per year.

Compare that to £10,490+ for UAE setups.

IBCs are designed for speed and simplicity:
Company formation in 1-2 days,
minimal paperwork,
zero tax on income earned outside the jurisdiction,
minimal compliance requirements.

No annual audits.
No detailed tax returns in the jurisdiction.

These jurisdictions built their business model on volume,
not high fees per company.

The result?
A lean, efficient way to operate internationally
at a fraction of the cost of traditional corporate structures.
