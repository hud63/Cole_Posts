🇲🇽 Why American retirees in Mexico are canceling their health insurance

In Mexico, healthcare is so affordable that many expats skip insurance entirely and just pay cash.

ER visit: $120
MRI: Under $100
Dental cleaning: $30
Pharmacy doctor visit: $3

These aren't co-pays. These are the full prices.

Most US prescription drugs? Over-the-counter in Mexico. For those that aren't, a $3 pharmacy appointment gets you the script on the spot.

Many retirees keep catastrophic coverage for major emergencies but handle day-to-day medical expenses out of pocket—freeing up thousands in premium payments for actual retirement living.

Some Americans are even flying to Mexico for dental work and major procedures, covering the entire vacation cost while still saving money.

Rent in smaller cities like Guanajuato or coastal towns: $250/month.

The combination of affordable housing and cash-pay healthcare is letting retirees stretch their savings 3-5x further than staying in the US.
