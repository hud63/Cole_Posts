🇺🇸 Most Americans leave $70,000+ per year on the table

If you have ANY self-employment income, even a few thousand from consulting, freelancing, or a side hustle, you qualify for a Solo 401k.

Here's what most people don't realize:

→ Deduct up to $70,000+/year from taxable income
→ Invest in anything: stocks, real estate, startups, even crypto
→ Tax-deferred growth (or tax-free with Roth version)
→ Borrow up to $50,000 from yourself if you need liquidity
→ Get up to $1,500 in tax credits over three years with EACA

You act as both employee AND employer, which means you can max out contributions way beyond a traditional IRA or corporate 401k.

The real power? 
You can use your Solo 401k to invest in rental properties, fund startups, or build a diversified portfolio, while your gains compound completely TAX-FREE inside the account.

This isn't a billionaire loophole. 
It's one of the most powerful retirement + tax optimization tools in America, 
and it's available to ANYONE with self-employment income.

I've put together a complete breakdown of how to set this up, maximize contributions, and use it strategically for both retirement and tax planning.
