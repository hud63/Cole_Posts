## Framework Post

AI isn't technology—it's outsourcing with better marketing.

Here's the framework that changes everything:

The Subscription Dependency Test.

When you "adopt AI," ask these 3 questions:

**Can I run this locally?**

Most AI requires external servers you'll never own.

You're not buying software.

You're renting access.

**What happens when I stop paying?**

Traditional technology becomes part of your toolkit forever.

AI subscriptions vanish the moment you stop paying.

Your productivity gains disappear instantly.

**Who owns my data?**

Real technology processes your data locally.

AI subscriptions harvest your conversations, processes, and creative work to strengthen their competitive advantage.

The framework reveals the truth:

We're not witnessing technological advancement.

We're watching cognitive work get outsourced to subscription companies.

What's one AI tool you use that passes this test?

## Story Post

Larry Ellison was right about cloud computing.

He called it marketing hype in 2008.

Eventually, Oracle started selling "cloud services" anyway.

Today, I'm having the same realization about AI.

Last week, I watched companies restructure entire workflows around ChatGPT subscriptions.

When the service had downtime, everything stopped.

When pricing changed, budgets scrambled.

When terms of service updated, legal teams panicked.

This reminded me of something:

Back in the 2010s, someone created a Chrome extension that replaced "the cloud" with "my butt."

Headlines became hilarious:

"Store your files in my butt."

"Access your data from my butt anywhere."

I tried the same experiment with AI:

"Companies are losing jobs to a subscription service."

"Productivity increased thanks to a monthly fee."

"Developers rely on another company's servers."

The substitution test reveals what we're really dealing with.

We're not adopting revolutionary technology.

We're creating expensive dependencies.

What happens when you replace "AI" with "subscription service" in your company's strategy?

## Listicle Post

5 signs you're trapped in AI subscription dependency:

**1. Your productivity vanishes when the service is down**

Real technology works offline.

Subscription services require constant connectivity.

**2. You pay monthly fees for basic functions**

Traditional software: buy once, use forever.

AI subscriptions: stop paying, lose everything.

**3. Your data trains their competitive advantage**

Anthropic now uses all conversations for training by default.

You must manually opt out.

Your work strengthens their market position.

**4. Switching costs keep growing**

You've built processes around their specific interface.

Teams trained on their particular outputs.

Moving to competitors requires starting over.

**5. You have zero control over changes**

They update algorithms without warning.

They change pricing whenever they want.

They modify terms of service unilaterally.

The reality check:

This isn't technology adoption.

It's cognitive work outsourcing with better marketing.

Which of these signs do you recognize in your current AI usage?
