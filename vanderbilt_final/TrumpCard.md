ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Trump's $1M Gold Card: The Most Expensive Immigration Route Ever Created  
  
The US just launched a three-tier visa program that transforms immigration into a luxury commodity. Gold Cards require $1 million for permanent residency, Corporate Cards cost $2 million per employee with transferable benefits, and Platinum Cards demand $5 million for 270 days of tax-free US access annually.  
  
This isn't traditional immigration.  
it's wealth-based residency...  
...with unprecedented pricing  
  
The Platinum Card creates a new tax-advantaged class  
Allowing holders to spend nine months yearly in the US  
WITHOUT paying taxes on foreign income.  
  
With 80,000 Gold Cards available and traditional visa categories potentially suspended within a month, this represents the most dramatic shift to pay-for-access immigration in US history.  
  
Early registration saw 69,000 people sign up in days when it was just a proposal. Now it's reality with a 90-day implementation deadline.  
  
This article breaks down all three tiers, eligibility requirements, and the application process. The most expensive citizenship program just went live.
