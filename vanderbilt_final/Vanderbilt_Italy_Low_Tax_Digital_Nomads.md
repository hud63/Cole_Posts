🇮🇹 Italy's 90% Tax Exemption: The Digital Nomad Game Changer for 2025

Italy just became Europe's top tax optimization destination with the Impatriate Regime offering a 90% income tax exemption when you relocate to southern regions like Sicily, Sardinia, or Puglia. Your effective tax rate drops to 4.3%.

You only pay tax on 10% of your income...
The benefit lasts 5 years...
And extends another 5 years at 50% exemption if you buy property or have a minor child.

Requirements are simple:
Not a tax resident in Italy for the last 2 years
Commit to 2 years residency minimum
Spend 183+ days per year in Italy

For smaller businesses under €65,000 revenue, the Regime Forfettario offers a flat 5% tax rate for your first 5 years, then 15% after that. No VAT, simplified accounting, minimal bureaucracy.

This comprehensive guide breaks down eligibility, CFC rules for US LLCs, social security requirements, and how to structure your move to maximize savings.
