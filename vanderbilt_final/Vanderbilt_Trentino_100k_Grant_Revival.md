🇮🇹 Trentino's €100k Grant to Revive Mountain Villages. Last Call

Italy's wealthiest region is offering up to €100,000 in grants to buy and renovate homes in 32 mountain villages and the deadline is approaching fast.

You get €80,000 for renovations (covering 40% of costs)
plus up to €20,000 toward purchasing a home in villages at risk of depopulation.

The first round drew 291 applications
with 90% from locals under 45
and even interest from Edinburgh and Brussels.
Top picks included Rabbi Valley, Novella, and Mezzano.

The €10 million fund's second round closes soon
with only two more rounds expected in 2026

Trentino has Italy's highest birth rate and best quality of life
making this the smartest "get paid to move" program in Europe.

This guide covers all 32 eligible villages, application requirements, deadlines, and the competitive first-come-first-served system. This is your last chance for 2025 funds.
