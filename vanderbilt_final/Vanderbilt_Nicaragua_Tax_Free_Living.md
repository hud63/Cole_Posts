🇳🇮 Nicaragua's Territorial Tax Regime: Zero Tax on Foreign Income

Nicaragua runs a territorial tax system that's a hidden gem for expats because you only pay tax on Nicaraguan sourced income while all foreign earnings remain completely tax exempt. Remote work, investments, and pensions from outside Nicaragua pay zero tax.

Income earner visa starts at just $750 per month...
Yearly renewals with citizenship available after 4 years...
And you bring $20,000 in goods duty free plus a vehicle.

Retirees get massive perks:
$50,000 in construction materials tax exempt
No wealth or inheritance tax on foreign assets
Property taxes just $137 per year on an acre with ocean views

The rentista visa requires minimal income proof...
No business investment needed...
And permanent residency costs just $250 if you handle it yourself.

This detailed guide covers visa pathways, cost of living in Granada and San Juan del Sur, new infrastructure projects, and how to structure your move for maximum tax savings.
