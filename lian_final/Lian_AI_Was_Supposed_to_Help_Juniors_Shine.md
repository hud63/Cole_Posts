üö® UNPOPULAR TRUTH: AI was never meant to help juniors shine. It was designed to make seniors unstoppable.

The narrative that "AI will democratize expertise" is Silicon Valley marketing BS.

Here's what's actually happening in dev teams:

üéØ **SENIORS ARE DOMINATING**
‚Ä¢ They spot AI hallucinations instantly
‚Ä¢ They know when to ignore bad architectural suggestions
‚Ä¢ They use AI to automate tedious work they already understand

üéØ **JUNIORS ARE STRUGGLING**
‚Ä¢ Submitting code they can't explain: "I don't know, Claude did that"
‚Ä¢ Getting lost in AI rabbit holes for days
‚Ä¢ Missing the critical "bullshit detection" skill

**The brutal reality?**

AI is a power tool. Give a chainsaw to a surgeon vs. a toddler. Guess who builds something vs. who creates chaos?

üî• **Why this matters for YOUR career:**

Experience isn't just knowing syntax‚Äîit's pattern recognition, architectural judgment, and knowing when something smells wrong.

AI amplifies what you already have. If you have deep expertise, you become superhuman. If you're still learning fundamentals, AI becomes a dangerous crutch.

**The companies that get this are already separating into two tiers:**
‚Ä¢ AI-enhanced seniors who are 10x more productive
‚Ä¢ Juniors who are increasingly replaceable by... more AI

This isn't about being anti-junior. It's about being realistic about how multipliers work.

**Your move:** Build real expertise first. Use AI as a force multiplier, not a replacement for understanding.

P.S. Have you noticed AI making you stronger or more dependent? What's been your experience?
