Brits dreaming of spending their retirement somewhere sunny and warm will be glad to find that a new study has named the world’s best country for retirement – and it’s closer to home than they might think. Retirement planning is no longer just about pensions and savings accounts; it’s also about lifestyle, health access, affordability and safety. And in 2025, one destination has quietly but firmly outdone all others, offering all of this and more.


According to the newly released Global Retirement Report by Global Citizen Solutions, it’s not just about good weather — although that certainly helps. With an average of 300 days of sunshine each year, multicultural cities and beautiful coastal rural landscapes, Portugal has clinched the title of best country in the world to retire in.

The report combined data from Numbeo and international indexes to present a full picture of what retirees truly value, from healthcare access to community engagement.

"High standards of living and quality healthcare with relatively low day-to-day expenses \[are\] an ideal combination for retirees on fixed incomes," the report stated.

Beyond the practicalities, it also credits Portugal with “high personal safety, supportive local attitudes, and the ability to communicate and participate fully in daily life”.

An attractive benefit for those seeking a smoother transition is Portugal’s D7 visa, tailored specifically for individuals with passive income, such as pensions or rental income.

The system is known for being efficient and expat-friendly, with “one of the fastest processing times in Europe for passive income and retiree visa applications, with routine times of two to four months”, according to the report.

Other factors driving Portugal’s position include its Global Peace Index score, English proficiency, and an overall sense of welcoming inclusiveness that makes integration less daunting.

And with flight times from the UK at just around three hours, family visits remain easy and affordable — an important factor for many retirees.
