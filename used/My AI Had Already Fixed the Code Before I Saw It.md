#### **Step 4: Keep context lean but yours**

The internet is full of "ultimate CLAUDE.md files" you can copy. Don't. Your context should reflect your codebase, your patterns, and your hard-won lessons. Ten specific rules you follow beat 100 generic ones. And when rules stop serving you, delete them. Living context means pruning as much as growing.

When I review my [CLAUDE.md/slash](http://claude.md/slash) command and agent files, it feels like reading my own software philosophy—a reflection of what I've learned, what I value, and how I think code should be built. If it doesn't resonate with you personally, it won't guide the AI effectively.

#### **Step 5: Trust the process, verify output**

This is the hardest step. Your instinct will be to micromanage and review every line. Instead, trust the system you've built—but verify through tests, evals, and spot checks. It's like learning to be a CEO or a movie director: You can't do everything yourself, but you can build systems that catch problems before they escalate. When something comes back wrong (and it will), teach the system why it was wrong. Next time, it won't be.

## **Stop coding, start compounding**

Here's what I know: Companies are paying $400 per month for what used to cost $400,000 per year. One-person startups are competing with funded teams. AI is democratizing not just coding, but entire engineering systems. And leverage is shifting to those who teach these systems faster than they type.

Start with one experiment log today. When something fails that shouldn't have, invest the time to prevent it from happening again—build the test, write the rule, and capture the lesson. Open three terminals. Try the three-lane setup: Plan in one, build in another, and review in a third. Say "pull request" and watch the branches bloom.

Then do it again tomorrow, and see what compounds.
