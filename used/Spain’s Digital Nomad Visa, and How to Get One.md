Recent anti-tourism protests might create an image that Spain isn’t a warm and welcoming place to outsiders. And it’s true that in some of the more tourism-heavy areas of the country, tourists might see banners telling them, in no uncertain terms, to go home.

But if you’re planning a longer stay — for instance, leaving the U.S. and making Spain your permanent home?

“In some regions of Spain, the government will pay you to move there and work remotely,” says Expatsi partner Alastair, half of our “Al and Alison” duo and cofounder of Moving to Spain. Expats coming to the country to become a part of the community and contribute to the economy generally receive a warm welcome, he says. And the Spanish government even offers a Digital Nomad Visa to make it easier for remote workers to come to Spain and do just that.

What is the Digital Nomad Visa?

Spain launched its Digital Nomad Visa in 2023 as part of an effort to encourage entrepreneurship and foreign investment. It allows remote workers and freelancers to work in Spain, for clients and companies outside of Spain, with a quick and easy application process (compared to the process for many other visas, at least).

To qualify, you’ll need:

Remote work for companies or clients outside of Spain
Income of at least twice Spain’s minimum wage (it comes to about $3,200 US per month) per main applicant
A university degree, professional certification, or several years of experience in your field
A clean criminal record
Private health insurance in Spain, or international coverage.

Your spouse or partner, dependent children, and/or dependent elders are also covered by your visa. The visa is valid for up to one year (or three, if you apply in Spain — more on that below) and can be renewed for up to five years, after which you can apply for permanent residency and start on the pathway to citizenship after 10 years.

One major benefit of living in Spain as a digital nomad is a tax break under Spain’s Beckham Law (their non-resident income tax program). You’ll only have to pay 24% on income up to €600,000 (just over $700,000 US), instead of having to pay Spain’s much higher progressive tax rates. “Not everyone qualifies, but it’s good to investigate and understand if your situation qualifies,” Alastair says. “You can save a lot, particularly if you make more than $50,000 to $60,000 a year, and you’re shielded from Spain’s wealth tax.”

How do I get one?

You can apply for your visa at your nearest Spanish embassy or consulate, but one of the nice features of the Digital Nomad Visa is that you can also apply for it while you’re already in Spain on a tourist visa (which is the method Alastair strongly recommends). Applying in Spain will generally provide faster results — as little as two weeks — you can apply for a three-year permit instead of just a one-year, and you can apply online. And you get to be in Spain.

In addition to the application itself, you’ll need to submit documentation including but not limited to your passport, proof of health insurance, proof of income, a criminal background check, and a certificate of working for or contracting with a non-Spanish company — the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides a list of the dozen or so documents needed.

Collecting all the necessary documents can take time, so you’ll want to have everything together before you solidify your travel plans. Alastair also recommends securing an immigration lawyer or other agent in Spain to make sure your application is complete and correct before you leave the U.S. “If you’re going to make the effort of coming over, you don’t want to arrive and not be able to apply,” he says.

Before you can start your application, you’ll need an NIE (a national identity number) and a Digital Certificate so you can apply for your visa online. You’ll receive them via email within about three weeks. Then you’re ready to apply online, pay your application fee, and wait until you’re told you can come get your visa.

Once you have your visa in hand, you’re almost done. You’ll still need to:

Find a place to live and register your home address
Open a bank account
Sign up as self-employed and register for Social Security
Make an appointment to get your TIE (your residence card) from your local police station
Apply for your health card.

Between the cost of your NIE (about €11.46), your UGE application (your application while in Spain, about €73.26), and your TIE card (€16.08), you’ll be paying about $125 US for the application process. Other paperwork — your FBI background check, apostille certificate, health insurance, bank documents, and legal and translation services — will vary depending on what you need and how quickly you need it.

For expert advice on making your move to Spain, we recommend our partners at Moving to Spain. They can help you enjoy Spain’s low cost of living, gorgeous climate, vibrant culture, and welcoming community, and possibly even get paid to do it, with the help of a visa specifically designed for digital nomads.
