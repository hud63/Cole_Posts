How to obtain citizenship through Public Benefit Option

Investment requirements

The minimum investment under the Public Benefit Option is $250,000 for a family of four.

For each additional family member from the fifth onwards, the amount increases by:

$25,000 for a child under 17;
$50,000 for each dependant aged 18 or over.

The contribution supports key infrastructure and development projects in St Kitts and Nevis, such as the Prime Creative Arts Centre, Basseterre High School, and National Housing Corporation.

Additional fees

Families of up to four do not pay the government processing fee until December 31st, 2025. This allows them to save up to $1,000. Larger families pay a $250 fee for each additional applicant.

Other fees remain unchanged:

Due Diligence — $10,000 for the main applicant and $7,500 for each dependant over 16;
certificate of naturalisation — $50 per applicant;
passport fee — $361 per applicant.
