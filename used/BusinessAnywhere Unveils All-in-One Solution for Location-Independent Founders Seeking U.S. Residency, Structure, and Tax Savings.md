**MIAMI, FL -** BusinessAnywhere, a leading platform for remote-friendly business services, has launched a game-changing product designed specifically for digital nomads and global entrepreneurs: the [Digital Nomad Kit](https://businessanywhere.io/digital-nomad-kit/). This all-in-one solution enables location-independent professionals to register a U.S. business, optimize taxes, and navigate residency planning—entirely online, from anywhere in the world.

As remote work, borderless entrepreneurship, and digital nomadism continue to redefine the global economy, BusinessAnywhere’s Digital Nomad Kit fills a critical gap. It provides a streamlined, step-by-step path to legally structuring a business in the United States—without requiring U.S. residency, citizenship, or a physical presence in the country.

**Solving the Biggest Problems Digital Nomads Face**

**For years, digital nomads have struggled with:**

- Unstable legal structures for their freelance or e-commerce businesses
- Banking limitations without a U.S. business entity
- Lack of access to Stripe, PayPal, and U.S.-based payment processors
- Unclear tax residency status, leading to overpayment or risk of audits
- Difficulty accessing proper legal advice and compliant documentation

The Digital Nomad Kit solves all of this with a single, comprehensive package designed for both U.S. citizens living abroad and non-U.S. persons building location-independent businesses.

**What’s Included in the Digital Nomad Kit**

**The product provides everything a digital nomad needs to:**

- Form a U.S. LLC in a founder-friendly state like Wyoming
- Get a U.S. address through a virtual mailbox
- Appoint a registered agent for compliance
- Apply for an EIN (Employer Identification Number) remotely
- Gain access to video consultations for strategic residency and tax planning
- Understand how to use the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) or territorial tax systems depending on their situation

It also comes with exclusive guides, templates, and legal document support to ensure full compliance with U.S. and international tax laws.

**Two Versions: One for U.S. Citizens, One for Non-Residents**

**Recognizing the distinct needs of different nomads, BusinessAnywhere offers two versions of the Digital Nomad Kit:**

**1\. For U.S. Citizens Living Abroad:**

- Strategic planning around the FEIE and Form 2555
- Guidance on maintaining or severing U.S. tax residency
- Tools to remain compliant with IRS regulations while minimizing taxes legally

**2\. For Non-U.S. Persons:**

- Structure a U.S. LLC with no U.S. tax liability if no ECI (Effectively Connected Income)
- File IRS Form 5472 + pro forma 1120 as required
- Access U.S. financial infrastructure without needing a Social Security Number

Both versions offer step-by-step clarity for setting up a business without the usual red tape.

**Built for Nomads, Freelancers, E-Commerce Founders, and Creators**

Whether you’re running a Shopify store from Bali, doing client work from Mexico City, or podcasting from Spain, the Digital Nomad Kit helps you:

- Register a U.S. company for legal protection and global credibility
- Get paid through U.S. platforms like Stripe and PayPal
- Open a U.S. business bank account remotely
- Protect your personal assets through LLC liability separation
- Plan your taxes and residency to legally reduce burdens

**It’s particularly ideal for:**

- E-commerce sellers
- Freelancers and consultants
- Content creators and YouTubers
- Amazon FBA and dropshipping business owners
- Coaches and online course creators

**Why Wyoming?**

**The Kit defaults to forming a U.S. LLC in Wyoming, thanks to its:**

- Zero state income tax
- Low annual reporting fee ($60)
- Owner anonymity (names not disclosed publicly)
- Asset protection laws
- Easy compliance for remote businesses

This makes it an ideal jurisdiction for remote-first businesses and solo entrepreneurs.

**A Fully Remote Solution—No Matter Where You Live**

Unlike traditional formation services, BusinessAnywhere is 100% remote. Clients don’t need a U.S. address, SSN, or even a trip to the U.S. to get started.

- The company provides a U.S. virtual mailbox for receiving mail
- EIN applications are filed on the client’s behalf
- A registered agent is assigned for state compliance
- All documentation and signatures are handled online

This makes it truly borderless—perfect for digital nomads in Europe, Asia, Latin America, or Africa.

**Designed for Tax Efficiency and Legal Compliance**

Beyond formation, the Digital Nomad Kit tackles one of the most complex aspects of international entrepreneurship: taxes.

**Depending on your nationality, income source, and country of residence, you may be able to:**

- **Eliminate U.S. federal tax through non-residency and no ECI**
- Avoid double taxation through tax treaties
- Claim the FEIE to exempt up to $120,000+ of earned income

Each version of the Kit includes strategy guidance and tax forms to simplify compliance.

**Expert Guidance Included**

**Users of the Digital Nomad Kit gain access to:**

- Recorded legal and tax planning sessions
- Tools for tracking physical presence for tax residency
- Ongoing education around residency, banking, and entity use
- Support from BusinessAnywhere’s global client services team

With thousands of entrepreneurs served globally, BusinessAnywhere combines legal credibility with location freedom.

**Why BusinessAnywhere?**

Founded by international entrepreneur Bobby Casey, BusinessAnywhere has helped founders in over 100 countries form U.S. companies, stay compliant, and optimize for mobility.

The platform already offers LLC formation, registered agent services, virtual mailbox, and online notary. The Digital Nomad Kit is the next evolution—delivering end-to-end support for those building truly global, remote-first businesses.

**Final Thoughts: The Future Is Borderless**

As the remote work movement accelerates, the demand for global-friendly business infrastructure is skyrocketing. But digital nomads, creators, and freelancers often lack access to legal, tax, and corporate tools that match their lifestyle.

With the Digital Nomad Kit, BusinessAnywhere has created a tailored solution that makes U.S. company formation, tax optimization, and residency planning finally accessible—for anyone, anywhere.

Whether you’re launching your first side hustle or building a six-figure remote business, this kit helps you protect your income, reduce your tax burden, and operate with confidence.
