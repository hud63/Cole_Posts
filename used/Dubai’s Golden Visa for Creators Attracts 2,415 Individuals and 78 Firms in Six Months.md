[Dubai’s Creators HQ](https://www.imidaily.com/mena/dubai-launches-golden-visa-program-for-content-creators/) program has enrolled 2,415 content creators from 147 countries and brought 78 companies from 24 nations since its launch in January 2025, according to [local media reports](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/content-creators-hq-countries?_refresh=true).

The most represented countries include the United Kingdom, Pakistan, the United States, India, France, and Germany.

In its next phase, the program aims to expand its membership to 10,000, although officials have not specified a timeline for hitting this target.

The program offers workspaces, training, and administrative support to its members. Participants also enjoy perks such as expedited access to the [Golden Visa program](https://www.imidaily.com/uae-golden-visa/), relocation assistance, and help with setting up businesses.

Dubai ruler Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the initiative and the US$40 million Content Creators Fund (CCF) in early 2024.

Commenting on the figures, Mohammad Abdullah Al Gergawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs, described the program as part of the UAE’s strategy to lead the global “content economy.”

He positioned the [Creators HQ program](https://creatorshq.com/) as a hub for creativity, skills development, and the production of “purposeful, impactful content.”

Officials also link the initiative to broader diversification goals, highlighting its positive economic impact on sectors such as tourism, retail, and education.

## Not just influencers

The program’s members include a wide range of content creators, such as social media influencers, filmmakers, and photographers, who are active across major online platforms. Officials say the program’s participants have a combined online audience and followers that “surpass 2.45 billion.”

In addition to individual creators, Creators HQ has drawn businesses specializing in areas such as production, content services, and tools for creators.

Authorities note that participants use the hub to connect with audiences, boost engagement, and contribute to campaigns focused on social, cultural, and economic issues. Yet, officials have not provided data on the program’s economic impact, such as job creation, local spending, or export revenue.
