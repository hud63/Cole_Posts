(00:00) China has launched a game-changing work visa that most people are not talking about. And as more people look away from the western English-speaking world, China could be the next country that they can target. Hello and namaste. My name is Narin Gori and welcome back to my channel. It just feels like a big big moment has passed since you and I spoke.
(00:25) Want to give you a quick update of where I've been. I think there were a lot of immigration changes that were drawing my attention. So, Globalology is now being revamped. We're going to be resuet network. Unfortunately, I don't think immigration changes are something that we as a team can control anymore. And another exciting update, I am an entrepreneur in residence with Antler Venture Capital here in Canada.
(00:44) I'm one of the top 50 entrepreneurs selected from all over the country. It's been intense, a lot of learning. I'm surrounded by amazing people and so a lot of time consuming research intensive things like shooting a YouTube long form or creating a YouTube long form took a backseat. I apologize but I'm back and I promise to stay as consistent as I can.
(01:02) So let's talk about what's happening in the world of immigration where a lot of exciting things are happening except that they're not happening in the English-speaking countries and that's fine. Talent moves where it's needed which is why China quietly launched a new visa called the K visa.
(01:16) So this visa is specifically for STEM professionals after all the 100k H1B debacle that was happening with the US and a lot of countries jumping guns like Canada and Europe saying this could be great for their countries and they would take on these tech talent easily. China did the smartest thing by actually creating an entirely new visa category.
(01:33) This visa is expected to go live on October 1st, 2025. So by the time you see this video, this will actually be live. And if you are a foreign professional looking for global opportunities, this could be the fastest way to put your foot into the second largest economy in the world. So I'm going to segment this video into three parts.
(01:51) First, we'll talk about what K visa is. Second, why does it really stand out? And third, why should you care? So first, let's talk about what exactly is K visa. Now this is a visa that's specifically designed for skilled talent, especially in fields like technology, science, research, and advanced industries. Unlike traditional work permits, the K visa gives you more flexibility, faster processing, and a clear pathway to long-term residence if you qualify.
(02:13) Which gets me to segment two, what makes it stand out? Number one, and the most important thing, eligibility for a K visa is based on your skills and your professional background. Also, it can be issued for multiple years and get renewed. In some cases, your family might also be able to join you on site. And finally, the process is much faster and quicker compared to China's traditional Zwork visa.
(02:33) So, honestly, why should you or anyone care? Well, everybody knows that English-speaking countries are right now struggling to attract the best of talent because a lot of misfit talent has entered and these economies are currently struggling with ineffective governance and misfit talent. While many of them are actively cutting immigration, China is investing billions of dollars into tech, AI, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing and the K visa is their way of opening the door to any talent that wants to be a part of this boom. So if you are
(03:00) somebody who has skills in demands and wants to work in Asia, the K visa is a serious look for you. If you want to apply for a K visa, just go on to the consular section of the Chinese embassy in your country and look for it. Now there are multiple visas out there. Don't get confused. Just go to the visa list and look for the letter K.
(03:17) Typically is in the second column. So look for the letter K and find it and apply for it. And if you think that you need help for this or if you think this is a great service that Resu Network can offer, let me know in the comments. As I rethink Resiu Network and the world of global opportunities overall, I hope you would consider doing the same for yourself.
(03:35) And on that note, this amazing video has come to an end. In the end, I only want to leave you with one question. What is your choice as an immigrant? Would you rather be on a work visa in an English-speaking country where you have no pathway to permanent residency or where the pathway to permanent residency is long and full of a lot of uncertainties or would you rather be on a visa which is in your control which is not in the control of employer sponsorship and where you have a clear pathway for permanent residency.
(04:01) Let me know which one would you choose. For me, the choice is obvious. I promise to see you in the next video. Until then, please make sure you take very good care of yourself. Stay safe, stay healthy, and let me know if you're applying for the K visa. Namaste.
