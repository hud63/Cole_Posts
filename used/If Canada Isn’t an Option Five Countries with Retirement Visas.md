### Countries that are mostly affordable, with sound democracies and good healthcare

I’ve [written before](https://canresist.substack.com/p/planning-a-us-exit-strategy-its-psychological?r=53y6ng) about the importance of having an exit plan right now, even if you never intend to use it. Knowing what options exist can reduce anxiety and give you a sense of agency. Canada is the most obvious choice for many Americans thinking about leaving, but for retirees, it isn’t realistic right now. Immigration policies, healthcare access, and financial requirements make it hard for most people over 60 to qualify. That doesn’t mean you’re out of options, however.

There are a number of other countries that welcome retirees through specific visas. Now if you are thinking this isn’t realistic, maybe read this [prior article](https://canresist.substack.com/p/cant-leave-the-us-are-you-sure?r=53y6ng) of mine. Below I’ve laid out five of them, with links to official government information and one video for each so you can start learning more. This is not meant to be exhaustive, as you’ll find a huge amount of information online about any one country. But I do hope this article provides you a place to get started.

## Portugal

Portugal has become one of the most popular destinations for retirees. The government offers what’s commonly called the **D7 visa**, often referred to as the “passive income” visa (though it seems recent changes to their website makes this terminology difficult to find, but look for AIMA-Authorization of Residency, which is where you start, and then also the long term stay visa. To qualify, you need to prove a stable income of about **$950 USD per month**, have private health insurance, and submit a background check. The visa is renewable and can lead to permanent residency and eventually citizenship after five years. Keep in mind with EU citizenship, you can live anywhere in the EU.

Portugal has a mild Mediterranean climate with around 300 sunny days a year. The cost of living remains lower than in the U.S., though housing costs in Lisbon, Porto, and parts of the Algarve have risen quickly because of expat demand. Healthcare is excellent and affordable, the country is politically stable, and residency gives you access to both the European Union and the Schengen area.

The drawbacks are worth noting. Housing can be expensive in popular areas, and in smaller towns you may run into a language barrier since English is less widely spoken. For someone planning to retire to Portugal, this is a manageable adjustment, but not something to ignore.

## Costa Rica

Costa Rica has long marketed itself as a retirement haven though it seems it has been changing in recent years. The country offers two main residency pathways for retirees. The **Pensionado Visa** requires proof of at least **$1,000 USD per month** in pension income. The **Rentista Visa** is for those without pensions and requires proof of **$2,500 USD per month** for two years, or a bank deposit of **$60,000 USD**. Details are available at the [U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica](https://cr.usembassy.gov/services/residency/).

Costa Rica is a stable democracy with abundant biodiversity, a relaxed pace of life, and a reputation for friendliness. Healthcare is strong, and the country exempts U.S. pensions and Social Security from taxation. Costs of living used to be lower than the U.S., though now quite comparably, especially places where you find tourists and expat enclaves.

Cons include the rainy season, which can last half the year depending on region, and healthcare access can be limited in rural areas. Crime rates have increased somewhat in recent years, shifting Costa Rica from a U.S. State Department Level 1 to Level 2 advisory. Unless you live in an expat enclave, Spanish is necessary.

## Mexico

Mexico is close to the U.S. and offers good healthcare at affordable prices, which makes it one of the most practical retirement destinations. Residency is possible through either a **Temporary Resident Visa** or a direct path to **Permanent Residency** for retirees. Find more information at the [Mexico Consulate](https://consulmex.sre.gob.mx/) in your nearest US city.

For temporary residency, you now need to hold that status for four years before applying for permanent residency. Financial requirements vary by consulate, but as a rough guideline, expect to show proof of around **$4,200 USD per month in income**, or **$70,000 USD in savings and investments**.

*If you are retired however*, you can apply directly for permanent residency. This typically requires proof of a ballpark of **$7,300 USD per month in income**, or **$300,000 USD in savings and investments**. Keep in mind these figures range a lot, depending upon which US consulate you apply through (I found the variation very surprising). In all cases, you’ll also need health insurance.

Mexico’s strengths include lower costs of living, excellent private healthcare (often with English-speaking doctors in major cities), and close proximity to the U.S. Climate diversity is also a plus, with choices ranging from temperate mountain towns to tropical coasts.

On the negative side, safety varies by region, and choosing the right location is crucial. Bureaucratic processes can be slow and sometimes inconsistent. Still, many U.S. retirees live comfortably and safely in Mexico.

## Spain

Spain’s retirement pathway is the **Non-Lucrative Visa**. This visa requires proof of financial means. As of 2025, the requirement is around **$38,000 USD in annual income** for a couple, plus health insurance and proof of accommodation. The official information is on the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs site, and the Los Angeles consulate page is a useful example: [Non-Lucrative Visa, Consulate of Spain in Los Angeles](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/losangeles/en/ServiciosConsulares/Paginas/Consular/Visado-de-residencia-no-lucrativa.aspx).

Spain offers an excellent quality of life. The climate is Mediterranean, healthcare is high quality and affordable, and you gain EU access. The cultural life is rich, with world-class cities and diverse regions to choose from.

The main challenges are financial. Spain has a wealth tax in some regions, which can impact retirees with significant assets. Bureaucracy can also be slow and frustrating. Still, for those who meet the financial requirements, Spain is a strong option.

## Ireland

Ireland provides a more limited retirement option through **Stamp 0 Permission**. Americans over 60 can apply, but the requirements are significant. You must show at least **€50,000/year** ***per person*** in income (around **$54,000 USD**) and also demonstrate a lump sum in savings and investments of about **€350,000 EUR** (≈ **$380,000 USD**). Private health insurance is required, and you must confirm you do not intend to work. The visa is renewable yearly but does not lead directly to citizenship.

The official application form is here: [Stamp 0 TPER Application Form](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TPER-Application-Form.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

And don’t forget that if you have a parent or grandparent of Irish descent, as many Americans do, you can apply for citizenship (which gives you access to the whole of EU to live).

Ireland’s strengths: A stable democracy, English is the national language, and healthcare is excellent. The climate is mild, with cool summers and relatively warm winters, and the cultural heritage is deep. Residency also gives you access to the EU.

The downsides are mostly financial and weather-related. The cost of living is high, especially in Dublin, and the weather can be cloudy and rainy much of the year. Still, for those with Irish ancestry, another path exists. If you have a parent or grandparent born in Ireland, you may be able to apply for Irish citizenship directly, which bypasses the need for Stamp 0.

## Final Thoughts

These five countries—Portugal, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, and Ireland—illustrate the diversity of retirement options available outside Canada or the U.S. None of them are simple, and all require paperwork, patience, and significant preparation. But they each provide a legal pathway for retirees to live abroad with long-term stability.

The decision comes down to your financial situation, language ability, tolerance for bureaucracy, and lifestyle preferences, such as distance from the US and weather. What looks ideal on YouTube may be quite different in reality. That’s why it’s important to research carefully, visit before committing, and talk to others who have gone through the process.

Having an exit plan doesn’t mean you’ll use it. But knowing your options puts in you a stronger position no matter what happens politically or personally in the years ahead.
