The key is choosing the right location and embracing local living. From Southeast Asian beaches to European historic towns, these destinations prove that a fulfilling retirement is possible on a pretty modest budget.

Albania

Albania offers Mediterranean charm at a fraction of the cost of its European neighbors. A couple can live comfortably here for well under $1,200 monthly, especially outside the trendy Blloku district in Tirana.

Rent is remarkably affordable. A one-bedroom apartment near the beach in Vlore costs around $350 per month, while utilities add another $75. Saranda, a popular beach town, offers similar pricing with two-bedroom places available for $465.

Food costs stay reasonable whether you cook or eat out. Local markets overflow with fresh produce at bargain prices, while a restaurant meal costs just a few dollars. Public transportation is incredibly cheap, with city bus rides costing 48 cents in Tirana and regional buses running $5 to $15 for multihour trips.

Bali

Bali proves that tropical island living doesn’t require wealth. At $1,200 monthly, retirees can enjoy a lifestyle that would cost three times as much in Western countries, including gym memberships ($25), fortnightly massages ($10) and regular dining out.

Rent varies dramatically by location. Tourist-heavy southern areas charge around $500 for basic accommodations, but you can also find hotel-style rooms with breakfast and pool access for $400. Utilities average just $80 monthly, particularly if you rely on ceiling fans instead of air conditioning.

Food is one of Bali’s biggest advantages. Restaurant meals are delicious and inexpensive and grocery shopping at Bintang supermarkets runs about 20% cheaper than U.S. prices for local items, though imports are obviously more expensive. International Living suggests shopping at local market stands for the best deals.

Transportation stays affordable through ride-hailing apps like Grab, with hour-long journeys under $20. Monthly scooter rentals cost $80 plus $20 for fuel, though navigating Bali’s chaotic roads requires caution. The key is avoiding tourist areas during high season when prices double and sticking to local neighborhoods where costs stay manageable year-round.

Bulgaria

Bulgaria delivers European living at Eastern European prices. A $1,200 monthly budget covers a modest apartment, home-cooked meals and public transport for two people, with room for occasional dining out and entertainment.

Location matters significantly. Sofia apartments average $685 for one bedroom, while similar units in Varna or Plovdiv rent for $500. Shopping at local markets for seasonal produce and meat keeps grocery bills around $245 monthly for two people. An inexpensive restaurant dinner for two costs just $18.

Basic utilities including electricity, water and internet run about $100, with mobile service adding another $18. Public transportation is efficient and cheap, making car ownership unnecessary. Bulgaria’s aging but improving train system connects cities inexpensively and provides affordable routes throughout Europe.

Cambodia

Cambodia has flown under the radar for years, but it offers exceptional value for retirees. In Phnom Penh, couples live comfortably on $1,200 monthly, with even lower costs in Siem Reap, Kampot and Battambang.

Housing provides major savings. Modern one-bedroom apartments in Phnom Penh with amenities like gyms and pools rent for $400, while simpler shop-house apartments go for $300. Smaller towns offer furnished apartments for as little as $200. Utilities are manageable, though air conditioning drives electricity bills to $70 to $100 monthly. Water costs just $5, and internet typically comes included in rent.

Food costs stay remarkably low. Rice noodle soup with pork costs $2.50, while stir-fry with rice runs $3. Couples eating three local meals daily spend about $540 monthly. Street food is even cheaper, with rice porridge costing about 75 cents.

Even better, transportation barely registers as an expense. Scooter owners spend about $5 monthly on fuel, maintenance and parking. Tuk-tuks through ride-hailing apps charge 40 cents per kilometer, making even long cross-city rides affordable.

Colombia

Colombia’s smaller cities offer a shopkeeper’s lifestyle, humble but comfortable, with access to middle-class perks. At $1,200 monthly, retirees enjoy decent housing, fresh food and occasional outings, with room for travel to charming small towns.

Cities like Pereira, Bucaramanga, Manizales and Armenia provide two- or three-bedroom apartments for $250-$400 monthly. These 50-60 square meter units may lack pools or gyms but offer solid, functional homes in safe neighborhoods. Bigger cities like Bogotá require spending more or living farther out.

Transportation costs are manageable. Manizales has safe, efficient buses for about $50 monthly including occasional taxis. As for food, groceries run about $200 monthly for couples who cook most meals at home, perfect for preparing Colombian tasty staples like arepas and sancocho.
