I have been out of the US since undergrad, which has been over 10 years now. I am now a dual US / EU citizen and have no plans to ever move back to the US.

Like many, I switched to SAVE. As someone abroad, when I file taxes each year the way my income is excluded meant my AGI was $0 so there was no interest accumulated on my loans. I planned to keep filing taxes and re-certifying until my loans were forgiven. (see this reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/17gsgdk/important_info_for_expatsamericans_living_or/) if you want for an explanation from someone else).

I am going to hate seeing my loan amount balloon with interest again, but am I right in thinking the best thing I can do is get back IBR and wait it out for forgiveness? I really thought I had finally put this to bed with SAVE and I have these changes.

> One thing to be very aware of is the FEIE benefit for IDR could change in the future at some point. For one, there is nothing that is forcing servicers to use AGI for US citizens living abroad. They could instead ask for foreign income pay stubs only for income verification. But there's also no current rumblings of them changing this.
> 
> US tax law could change as well. In the GOP draft bill in January, there was an early proposal to eliminate US tax filing for US citizens living abroad. This did not make it into the BBB draft. But if this were eliminated, the FEIE would be moot, and servicers would then require only pay stubs for income verification for borrowers living abroad. For now, this is also not a very big risk to happen anytime soon.

> But if someone abroad were 10 or 15 or 20 years from IDR forgiveness, and they were specifically banking on taking advantage of the FEIE for $0 IDR payments, that would seem a pretty risky move.

But even still if you are setting aside and banking, say for example, $500 per month that you are not required to pay with your $0 monthly IDR payment, that savings adds up to $60k after 10 years.

Up until just a few years ago, there was a pretty good deal of bipartisan support in Congress for keeping student loan forgiveness as tax exempt. Then MAGA really took hold of the Republican party and everyone on that side fell in line against forgiveness tax exemption. Things could keep going into an extreme direction rightward, or the pendulum could swing back pretty significantly. Anyway, the point is, we really have no idea what the future is for the tax bomb.

I also work for a tax-exempt international organization but I have no idea how that would if things change. Not thinking about it now though because no use in doing that mental work unless its needed.
