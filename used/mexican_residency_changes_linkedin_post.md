# LinkedIn Post: Mexican Residency Income Requirements Change

ðŸš¨ Big news for anyone considering Mexican residency: The financial requirements are about to change dramatically in 2026.

Here's what's happening and why it could save you thousands:

The Mexican government just announced they're switching from minimum wage calculations to UMA (Unidad de Medida y ActualizaciÃ³n) for residency income requirements.

This isn't just bureaucratic shuffling. It's potentially game-changing for your wallet:

- Current 2025 trajectory would push requirements to $5,000+ USD/month
- Under the new UMA system: likely around $4,100 USD/month  
- Savings requirements dropping from $85,000+ to approximately $70,000

Why this matters for your financial planning:

1/ Mexico's minimum wage jumped 12% this year alone.
Using minimum wage calculations meant exponential increases in residency requirements each year. UMA increases are historically much smallerâ€”typically 3-5% annuallyâ€”making your financial planning predictable and sustainable.

2/ The timing creates a strategic opportunity.
If you've been waiting to apply for Mexican residency, the UMA adoption could represent significant savings versus waiting another year. The difference between $5,000/month and $4,100/month income requirements is $10,800 annually.

3/ Not all consulates may adopt this immediately.
The announcement came from Mexico's top immigration authority, but consulates operate with discretion. Some may implement quickly, others may delay or ignore entirely. Early movers could benefit most.

The caveat: Implementation timeline remains unclear. The official announcement suggests August 9th, 2025, but Mexican consulate coordination varies significantly.

My recommendation? If Mexican residency is part of your wealth preservation or international diversification strategy, start preparing documentation now. Whether UMA gets adopted or not, having your financial house in order positions you for success.

The bigger picture: This change signals Mexico's recognition that residency programs need sustainable, predictable frameworksâ€”not just barriers that rise with domestic wage inflation.

What's your take on Mexico's residency requirements? Are you planning to apply in 2026?
