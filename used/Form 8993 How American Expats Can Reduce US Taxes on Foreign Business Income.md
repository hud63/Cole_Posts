If you’re an American expat entrepreneur feeling overwhelmed by US tax compliance while growing your international business, Form 8993 might be your solution. This form calculates your [Section 250 deduction](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/blog/section-250-deduction-expat-business-taxes/) for [foreign-derived intangible income (FDII)](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/foreign-derived-deduction-eligible-income/) and [global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI)](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/gilti-form-8992/), potentially eliminating substantial US tax liability when properly completed.

Form 8993 provides a 37.5% deduction for FDII and a 50% deduction for GILTI, which can translate to thousands in tax savings. We’ve helped thousands of expats with complex business forms like this, and many discover they owe far less than expected.

## What Is Form 8993 and Who Must File It?

Form 8993 calculates your [Section 250 deduction](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/blog/section-250-deduction-expat-business-taxes/), which provides tax relief for US businesses earning income from foreign sources. The form determines two key deductions that can dramatically reduce your US tax bill:

- **[Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII)](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/foreign-derived-deduction-eligible-income/):** Income from selling products or services to foreign customers
- **[Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/gilti-form-8992/):** Income from foreign subsidiaries exceeding a 10% return on assets

**You must file Form 8993 if you’re:**

- A US corporation with foreign sales or foreign subsidiaries
- An American expat with a US corporation conducting international operations
- A business owner claiming [Section 250 deductions](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/blog/section-250-deduction-expat-business-taxes/) for the 2025 tax year

Important

This form applies to incorporated businesses, not sole proprietorships or partnerships. If you’re a freelancer or consultant abroad, you likely don’t need Form 8993 but may benefit from the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/tips-updates-foreign-earned-income-exclusion/) instead.

## How Can Form 8993 Reduce Your US Tax Bill?

The [Section 250 deduction](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/blog/section-250-deduction-expat-business-taxes/) allows a 37.5% deduction for FDII and a 50% deduction for GILTI. Here’s how these savings work:

### FDII Example:

- Your US corporation earns $100,000 from software sales to European customers
- After calculating your foreign-derived ratio, you have $80,000 in FDII
- Section 250 deduction: $80,000 × 37.5% = $30,000
- Tax savings: $30,000 × 21% corporate rate = $6,300

### GILTI Example:

- Your foreign subsidiary generates $50,000 in excess returns
- Section 250 deduction: $50,000 × 50% = $25,000
- Tax savings: $25,000 × 21% corporate rate = $5,250

Take Note

Many expat entrepreneurs miss these deductions because they don’t realize their international sales qualify for FDII treatment. That’s thousands of dollars in potential savings left unclaimed.

## Do You Need to File Form 8993?

### Form 8993 makes sense if you:

- Have significant foreign sales through a US corporation
- Own foreign subsidiaries generating substantial income
- Want to reduce US taxes on international business activities
- Can properly document your foreign-derived income

### The form doesn’t apply if you:

- Operate as a sole proprietorship (use [Form 2555](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/form-2555/) instead)
- Have minimal foreign-source income
- Lack proper documentation for foreign sales

## What Are the Key Deadlines for Form 8993?

Form 8993 must be filed with your corporate tax return (Form 1120) by:

- **March 17, 2026,** for tax year 2025 returns
- **September 15, 2026,** with automatic extension

Important

Unlike individual expat returns, corporations don’t receive the automatic June 15 extension. You must file Form 7004 to request additional time.

## How Do You Calculate Your Section 250 Deduction?

### Part I: Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII)

- **Step 1:** Calculate your deduction eligible income (DEI) from Form 8992
- **Step 2:** Determine your [deemed intangible income (DII)](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/deemed-intangible-income/)
- **Step 3:** Calculate your foreign-derived ratio based on foreign sales
- **Step 4:** Multiply DII by your foreign-derived ratio to get FDII

### Part II: Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)

- **Step 1:** Enter the GILTI amount from [Form 8992](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/gilti-form-8992/)
- **Step 2:** Calculate your Section 250 deduction for GILTI

### Part III: Section 250 Deduction

- **Step 1:** Apply the taxable income limitation
- **Step 2:** Calculate your final [Section 250 deduction](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/blog/section-250-deduction-expat-business-taxes/)

The deduction cannot exceed 37.5% of your taxable income for FDII or 50% for GILTI, preventing the deduction from creating a loss.

## What Are Common Expat Business Scenarios?

### Software Developer in Germany

Sarah runs a US corporation in Berlin that sells software globally. Her $200,000 in foreign sales generates $75,000 in FDII deductions, saving her $15,750 in US taxes while qualifying for the [Foreign Tax Credit](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/foreign-tax-credit-guide/) on any remaining liability.

### Manufacturing Business in Thailand

Mike’s US corporation manufactures products in Thailand for export. His foreign-derived income qualifies for FDII treatment, reducing his US tax bill by $12,000 annually.

Elena’s US corporation serves European clients exclusively. Her entire business income qualifies for FDII deductions, eliminating most of her US corporate tax liability.

## What Are Common Form 8993 Mistakes to Avoid?

- **Incorrect Foreign-Derived Ratio Calculation:** Many expats miscalculate what constitutes “foreign use” of their products or services. The [IRS provides specific guidance](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8993) on determining where income is derived.
- **Missing Documentation:** Keep comprehensive records of foreign sales and customer locations. The IRS requires detailed documentation supporting your foreign-derived income claims.
- **Overlooking the Taxable Income Limitation:** The Section 250 deduction is limited to a percentage of your taxable income. Don’t assume you can deduct the full calculated amount.
- **Forgetting About Foreign Tax Credits:** Coordinate Form 8993 deductions with [foreign tax credits](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/foreign-tax-credit-carryover/) to optimize your overall tax position.

## What If You’re Behind on Filing?

If you’ve missed filing Form 8993 in previous years, you might be eligible for significant tax savings through [amended returns](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/amended-tax-return/). The IRS allows you to claim previously missed deductions within the statute of limitations.

**No matter how late, messy, or complex your return may be, we can help.** Our CPAs and Enrolled Agents have experience helping expat business owners claim Section 250 deductions they didn’t know existed.

## How Does Form 8993 Coordinate with Other Expat Tax Benefits?

Form 8993 works at the corporate level, while individual expat benefits like the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/tips-updates-foreign-earned-income-exclusion/) apply to personal income. You can often use both:

- **Corporate level:** Form 8993 reduces your corporation’s taxable income
- **Individual level:** FEIE excludes up to $130,000 of your personal foreign-earned income
- **Credit coordination:** The [Foreign Tax Credit](https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/knowledge-center/form-1116/) can offset remaining tax liability

This multi-layered approach often results in minimal US tax liability for expat entrepreneurs with proper planning.
