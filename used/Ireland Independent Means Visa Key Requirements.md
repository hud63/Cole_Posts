The Ireland Independent Means Visa allows financially self-sufficient individuals to live in Ireland long-term without needing to work or study.

To qualify, applicants must typically demonstrate a minimum annual income of €50,000 and have access to significant savings.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about the Irish independent means visa, from eligibility rules to common pitfalls.

We’ll cover:

How many types of Ireland visas are there?

What is the Ireland Independent Means Visa?

The Ireland Independent Means Visa—officially referred to as the Long Stay ‘D’ Visa for Persons of Independent Means—is a residency option for non-EEA nationals who wish to live in Ireland without taking up employment or relying on state support.

This visa is specifically intended for financially self-sufficient individuals who can fully support themselves through passive income or personal wealth.

Holders of this visa are not permitted to work or access public funds, and they must maintain private health insurance for the duration of their stay.

It appeals particularly to retirees, global nomads, and high-net-worth individuals seeking a peaceful, stable lifestyle in Ireland while enjoying its cultural richness, scenic beauty, and strong legal protections.

What are the different visa types for Ireland?

Stamp 0: Issued to persons of independent means, elderly dependents, or those on time-limited, conditional residence. It requires proof of substantial financial resources and prohibits employment or access to public funds.

Stamp 1: Granted to individuals who hold a valid employment permit, such as a Critical Skills or General Employment Permit. This stamp allows you to live and work in Ireland under the conditions of your permit.

Stamp 2: Assigned to non-EEA students enrolled in full-time, approved courses. It permits part-time work (up to 20 hours per week during term and 40 hours during holidays) but does not lead to long-term residency by itself.

Stamp 3: Given to volunteers, religious ministers, or family members of certain visa holders. It does not allow employment or business activity.

Stamp 4: Offers broader rights, including permission to work without an employment permit. It’s typically granted to long-term residents, refugees, spouses of Irish citizens, and certain investor or entrepreneur visa holders.

Ireland visa application

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the application process:

1. Complete the Long-Stay (D) Visa Application Form via AVATS
    
    Begin by registering on the AVATS online system, which is Ireland’s official visa application portal. Select “Visa D” as the type and indicate the purpose of your stay as “person of independent means.”
    
2. Prepare the required supporting documents
    
    You’ll need to gather a comprehensive set of documents, including:
    
    - A notarized cover letter explaining your reasons for moving to Ireland
        
    - Evidence of sufficient financial resources
        
    - Recent bank statements covering the last six months
        
    - Proof of accommodation in Ireland (e.g., lease agreement or property deed)
        
    - Private health insurance that provides full cover while residing in Ireland
        
    - Valid passport and recent passport-sized photographs
        
3. Submit your application to the Irish Embassy or Consulate
    
    Once your application is completed and your supporting documents are in order, you must post or deliver the full application package to the Irish Embassy, Consulate, or designated visa office in your country of residence. Application procedures and mailing addresses may vary slightly by location.
    

Important: You must apply for this visa from outside Ireland. You cannot enter the country as a tourist and then attempt to regularize your stay under this visa type.

Ireland independent means visa requirements

To qualify for the Ireland Independent Means Visa (Stamp 0), here are the key requirements in detail:

Proof of Annual Income (Minimum €50,000 per person)

Applicants must demonstrate a secure and verifiable source of income such as pensions, investment returns, property rental income, or dividends, amounting to at least €50,000 per year for each adult. Married couples are generally expected to have a combined annual income of at least €100,000.

Access to a Lump Sum for Contingencies

In addition to annual income, applicants must show they have access to a lump sum of savings (typically €100,000 or more) to cover unforeseen expenses such as medical emergencies, home maintenance, or repatriation if necessary.


Ireland visa processing time

Processing times vary, but applications for long-stay visas such as this one typically take 8 to 12 weeks.

What are the benefits of having an Irish visa?

Legal long-term stay in Ireland

The visa allows non-EEA nationals to reside in Ireland for extended periods without needing employment.

Access to high-quality healthcare (via private insurance)

While public healthcare isn’t automatically available, private health insurance ensures access to excellent medical facilities.

Option to apply for long-term residency after several years

While time under Stamp 0 may not always count toward citizenship, it can support future applications for residency extensions or long-term residence under other categories.

Ability to live in a stable, English-speaking EU country

Ireland offers a high standard of living, political stability, and the benefits of being in the European Union; all while maintaining English as a primary language.

No requirement to work or invest actively

Ideal for retirees or remote wealth holders, this visa removes the pressure to secure a job or start a business to maintain residency.



Conclusion

The Ireland Independent Means Visa offers a path to living in Ireland long-term under Stamp 0 conditions, with the freedom to enjoy the country’s rich cultural landscape, safety, and EU residency status.
