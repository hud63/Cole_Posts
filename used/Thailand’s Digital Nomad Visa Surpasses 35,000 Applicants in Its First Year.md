Thailand’s *Destination Thailand Visa* (DTV) program has drawn over 35,000 applicants since its [launch exactly a year ago](https://www.imidaily.com/asia-pacific/thailand-introduces-practically-free-visa-for-digital-nomads-and-remote-workers/). The visa aims to attract digital nomads and remote workers by offering an affordable and flexible long-term stay option, making it a key component of the country’s efforts to bolster its tourism and economy.

The DTV offers a five-year, multiple-entry visa, enabling holders to stay in Thailand for up to 180 days at a time. Applicants must demonstrate financial reserves of 500,000 baht (approximately US$15,500) and pay a one-time application fee of 10,000 baht (around US$310).

These relatively low financial requirements, combined with Thailand’s good infrastructure and affordable cost of living, have made the visa particularly attractive to remote professionals. The DTV stands out as a more accessible option compared to [higher-cost alternatives in Southeast Asia](https://www.imidaily.com/imis-complete-digital-nomad-visa-guide/).

In addition to standard pathways for digital nomads, freelancers, and self-employed individuals, the program offers unique eligibility options. Applicants can qualify by engaging in activities such as learning Thai boxing, taking cookery courses, or participating in medical and wellness tourism, pathways that broaden the program’s appeal.

## DTV’s Administrative Challenges

Despite the program’s popularity, it has also faced some administrative challenges. The DTV’s classification as a long-term tourist visa has created complications for some holders.

Several applicants have struggled to open or maintain bank accounts in Thailand, according to [local media reports](https://www.pattayamail.com/latestnews/news/destination-thailand-visa-in-the-crosshairs-again-509997). Banks have often required applicants to provide extensive documentation, creating frustration and delays for visa holders who rely on local financial services.

Authorities also initially indicated that DTV holders could extend their stay domestically for an additional six months within the year. But this option appears to have been unreliable, as immigration officials have [reportedly](https://www.pattayamail.com/latestnews/news/destination-thailand-visa-in-the-crosshairs-again-509997) not fully supported the tourism ministry-led DTV. As a result, some applicants who expected seamless extensions have had to leave and re-enter the country to reset their stay periods.
