Golden visas in Latin America typically refer to residency or citizenship-by-investment programs that grant foreign investors legal residency—and in some cases, eventual citizenship—in exchange for investments in real estate, businesses, or government bonds. While these programs aren’t usually branded as “golden visas,” several Latin American countries offer attractive pathways for investors. Here are some of the most notable options in the region:

Panama’s ‘Golden Visa’ or Residency by Investment Program

The Panama Golden Visa offers one of the most appealing residency by investment paths in Latin America. It provides a range of benefits and options for investors and their families.

Most Notable Benefits

One of the most notable advantages of Panama’s investor visa lies in the country’s strategic geographic location. For many investors, location is a crucial factor—and in this case, Panama stands out as an ideal gateway to both Central and South America. Its central position makes it easy to reach neighboring markets, facilitating regional expansion and cross-border business opportunities.

Panama is also home to the Panama Canal, one of the world’s most vital trade routes. This global logistical asset significantly enhances the country’s appeal to international investors seeking connectivity and access to global commerce.

Another major benefit of Panama’s visa program is its family-friendly structure. The visa can be extended to include a spouse, children, dependent parents, and disabled relatives, making it a comprehensive option for those seeking to relocate with their families.

Additionally, Panama offers a favorable tax regime for foreign investors. The country does not tax income earned outside its borders, providing a business-friendly environment for international entrepreneurs. Perhaps most notably, the investor visa grants permanent residency from day one, allowing applicants to quickly establish legal residency without the need to pass through temporary visa stages, as is common in other countries.

Panama’s Golden Visa Program Requirements

There are multiple options to guarantee the right to reside in Panama, the country offers different routes making it appealing to more people.

Qualified Investor: The Qualified Investor Visa grants permanent residency by investment. To be a qualified investor these are the options: Invest a minimum of US$ 500,000 in Panama real estate, invest at least US$ 500,000 in the Panamanian stock market, or deposit a minimum of US$ 750,000 in a fixed-term account at a Panamanian bank. It is important to highlight that it is required to hold the minimum investment for at least 5 years.

Friendly Nations: The Friendly Nations Visa is for citizens from specific countries that maintain friendly relations with Panama. To acquire this kind of visa you need to; start a business in Panama or make a work agreement with a Panamanian company, invest minimum US$ 200,000 in real state or deposit US$ 200,000 in a fixed-term deposit account at a national bank in Panama, which must be valid for a minimum of 3 years.

Forestry Investor: The Forestry Investor Visa focuses on sustainable investment in Panama’s reforestation projects. To obtain this visa you need to invest a minimum of US$ 800,000 in an approved reforestation project to get a temporary residence permit for five years, and there is no option to extend it–this kind of investment does not offer Panamanian citizenship. Another option is to invest US$100,000 to acquire a temporary resident permit for two years, meaning you’ll get a temporary residence, and then you are eligible to get a permanent residence permit. After five years, the permanent residency in Panama opens the way to applying for Panamanian Citizenship. Or invest a minimum of US$ 350,000 to get immediate permanent resident status and a Panamanian ID which will also be extended to family dependents.

Important to keep in mind that to qualify for the Panama Golden Visa, the application process and required documents vary depending on the chosen route.

The Golden Visa Program of Brazil, Latin America’s biggest economy

Brazil’s Golden Visa Program is another attractive alternative in the region. It distinguishes itself by granting immediate permanent residency upon approval–a rare advantage in a market where most countries begin with temporary permits. Applications are typically processed within four to six months.

The programs minimal residency requirements further enhance its appeal: visa holders need to spend just 14 days in Brazil every two years to maintain their status. This level of flexibility makes it particularly attractive to global investors seeking mobility without the need for full relocation.

Holders of this visa gain the right to live, work and operate businesses anywhere in Brazil. The visa also opens a clear and accessible path to Brazilian citizenship after only 4 years of residency.

Furthermore, Brazil permits dual citizenship, allowing investors to acquire a second passport without renouncing their original nationality. As European golden visa programs face tighter regulations and reduced benefits, Brazil’s offering stands out as a strong contender in the global residency-by-investment landscape.

It’s also worth noting that a Brazilian passport holder can enjoy visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 171 countries, including key destinations such as the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and all the countries within the Schengen Area. This global mobility makes Brazilian citizenship a valuable asset for international investors.

How can investors qualify for a Brazilian Golden Visa?

An important point to consider is that Brazil aims to attract approximately US$200 million in foreign investment during the program’s first year, while offering one of the most affordable residency-by-investment pathways among major economies.

Investors can qualify by purchasing property worth US$200,000 in Brazil’s South, Southeast or Center-West regions. The government provides a 30% discount for investments in the developing North and Northeast regions, lowering the threshold to US$140,000.

Also, foreigners can invest US$ 100,000 in new or existing Brazilian corporations to secure residency. The program offers an even lower entry point of US$30,000 for investments in innovation, science and technology sectors.

As Golden Visa programs continue evolving globally, Brazil’s entry represents an emerging opportunity in a market where accessible options are becoming increasingly limited. Additionally, Brazil stands out as a competitive option against European programs as it offers key access to Latin America’s largest economy.
