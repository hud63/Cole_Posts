How Business Owners in California and New York Pay Less in Taxes (The PTET Workaround)

If you live in a high tax state, you can pay your state taxes through your business and save tens of thousands in taxes

The PTET Workaround: How Business Owners in California and New York Pay Less in Taxes

Consider this scenario:

You are a physician in California earning $1M a year.

California has high state taxes, so you pay more than $100,000 in state taxes.

How much of that $100,000+ can you deduct from your federal tax return?

The answer depends on how you earned that money.

If you earn $1M as a W-2 employee, you are limited by a maximum deduction of $10,000.

And it gets worse if you are married: your $10,000 limit is combined with your spouse

However, if you have your own business and work for yourself, you can potentially deduct the entire $100K+ from your federal return!

The way you do this is by using a tax loophole called the Pass-Through Entity Tax or PTET.

This allows you to pay an optional state tax through your business, resulting in the entire amount being deductible.

Same exact income, but $25,000+ less in federal taxes for the business owner!

This issue is brought to you by Offsite…

They handled everything for us: venue scouting, flights, logistics, even curating activities for our team that actually brought us closer together.

Now they’re giving away $25,000 worth of Offsite planning services to one lucky company planning a retreat for up to 100 guests.

It’s frankly a no-brainer to talk with their team (even if you aren’t the winner)!

If you’re even just considering an offsite in 2026, you can apply in just a few minutes.

State and Local Taxes (SALT) Deduction

Prior to 2017, you could deduct the entirety of what you paid in state and local taxes (SALT) from your federal tax return.

You would have to itemize your taxes (versus taking the standard deduction) but could theoretically deduct your entire state and local tax bill.

But the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was a devastating development for tax payers in high tax states. This bill introduced a new maximum deduction of only $10,000 for ALL state and local taxes combined.

To make matters worse, this $10,000 limit was the same for single and married filers. This effectively put married filers in high tax states in the worst possible position.

This was a very contentious and massively political change. This disadvantaged a lot of the blue states like California and New York while barely affecting states with no state taxes like Texas and Florida.

After much debate, this deduction was revised in the new One Big, Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in 2025.

As of today, there is a new temporary increase to the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 for the 2025 to 2029 tax years, before it goes back to $10,000.

But, there are additional restrictions on the $40,000 cap:

The full increased SALT cap is only available if your income is under $500,000 or less.
Above that threshold, the cap is reduced by 30% of how much your income exceeds $500,000.
At $600,000 or more, your SALT cap is right back where it started at only $10,000.

So for truly high earners, the increased SALT cap would not apply as if you make over $600,000, you are right where you started at a combined $10,000 SALT cap.

Tough.

The States Fight Back: Emergency of PTET

This new tax policy had an immediately deleterious effect on all the states that had relatively high state taxes.

This made living in and running a business in these states less attractive — and the states were looking for a way to fight back.

In 2018, Connecticut was the first state that created the notion of the pass-through entity tax (PTET) which was a genius rebuttal to federal tax policy.

The pass-through entity tax allows business owners to pay a completely optional tax to the state as a legitimate business expense.

As a business expense, this tax would reduce taxable income, and thereby be fully deductible!

The state would also provide a state tax credit for this optional tax paid.

The IRS initially scrutinized this approach before fully green-lighting it as valid in 2020.

After that, virtually every single state with state taxes (and the city of NYC) ended up passing their own version of PTET.

The interesting thing to note about PTET is while the general concept works relatively similarly across states — the actual implementation details like deadlines and filing requirements vary drastically.

It’s worth doing your research and reading up on your states specific implementation of PTET.

How to Qualify for PTET

This strategy also definitely fits into the bucket of something a qualified tax professional can not just help with, but also effectively pay for themselves by saving you a bundle of money implementing this correctly.

Here are the major considerations as you think through PTET:

Business Type

As the name suggests, this workaround is primarily for pass-through entities. This means C-Corporations are usually not eligible for this.

You typically need to have a partnership or an S-Corp in order to qualify for the PTET workaround.

What do you do if you are a sole proprietor?

It could be worth running the math to see if an S-Corp makes sense, or whether it’s worth bringing on a very small minority partner to make yourself eligible for this workaround.

If you do have a partnership, some states may require unanimous consent of all partners to opt into this program.

Election Deadlines

It’s insane how variable the deadlines to elect PTET are for different states, with some of them being an entire year apart.

For the 2025 tax year for instance, here are the deadlines for a handful of different regions:

New York state - March 15 2025
New York City - March 15 2025 (but requires a NYS PTET election first)
California - June 15 2025
New Jersey - March 15 2026

So if you happen to live across the Hudson river in New Jersey, you end up having a whole extra calendar year to make your PTET election.

Filing Requirements

Like the deadlines, the filing requirements also vary dramatically by state. Don’t DIY this and work with a qualified tax professional!

There are typically 5 separate steps:

1. Making the election
2. Make your estimated payments through the calendar year
3. File your annual state return
4. Claim the state tax credit in return. Some states offer refundable credits, some non-refundable.
5. Since it’s fully deductible as a business expense, you end up owning no federal taxes on this.

Is PTET worth it?

Are the tax savings from PTET worth the additional hassle and administrative complexity you would have to incur?

Like most things, the answer here is: it depends.

A few things I would consider in making this decision:

Your federal tax bracket — the higher your federal tax bracket, the greater the potential savings from PTET
Your incorporation type — are you already an S-Corp or a partnership, or would you be choosing the structure just for PTET
The complexity of your states interpretation of PTET — reporting requirements vary by state, as well as the actual benefits (refundable vs non-refundable credits)
Your actual business owner income — this is likely the single most important factor as it illustrates what the savings could be

I decided to model this out with a purely theoretical scenario with the following assumptions:

You pay state taxes at a tax rate of 10% (similar to California and New York)
You are at your SALT cap limit with other taxes (either via your spouse or property taxes or something else)

Looking at these numbers, this becomes a no-brainer to implement past the new SALT cap phaseout… which starts at $500,000 a year.

And if you are fortunate enough to be at 7-figures a year, this can put an additional $30,000 or more in your pocket, every single year.

As a thank you, I spent the last two weeks clarifying the best tax strategies to reduce your tax bill before the end of this year.

It’s everything I wish I knew when I was getting started with tax strategy (and I’m continuing to update it every day with new insights!).
