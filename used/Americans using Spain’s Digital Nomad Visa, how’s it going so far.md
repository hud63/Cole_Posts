I’m a 36-year-old gay man from Chicago, currently working remotely in tech, and my partner and I have been talking about making the move to Spain this year. The Digital Nomad Visa sounds like a great fit for us, lower taxes and a better pace of life but I’ve heard mixed stories about the process really is.

We’ve been looking mostly at Valencia or Malaga since we’d prefer a smaller, more relaxed city over Madrid or Barcelona. But we’re a bit nervous about the bureaucracy,getting the NIE, opening a bank account, and figuring out the whole tax situation as Americans.

If you’ve already made the move, how’s it going for you so far? Was the visa process manageable, And for LGBTQ+ folks, how’s the community vibe, is it welcoming, inclusive, safe?

Lower taxes seems unlikely...
I'm living in Valencia and loving it. I'm just on a tourist visa. You do occasionally see some tourist hate graffiti or signs, but I've yet to feel it in an interaction with someone.

There’s the Beckham Rule which can make your taxes pretty low.

For the purpose of Americans interested in the Spain DNV, you’re either a W-2 employee and eligible for the Beckham rule (which usually makes it much harder to get approved for the DNV in the first place, since your employer has to agree to pay Spanish social security taxes) or you’re self-employed and ineligible for it

Yes however the amount of bureaucracy and people you have to pay /or hire to manage things eats that up quickly.(lawyers and accountants, both US and Spain side for accountants if you have anything other than a straightforward financial case like most digital nomads do)
Yes, you have to pay people to get your NIE appointment and anyone saying otherwise is lying. I'm talking about in BCN, it might be easier elsewhere. (It's an open secret there's a bot mafia that swipes up the appointments immediately and sells them)

If ur from USA then you still have to pay USA taxes. You can get FEIE though and also credit for any tax you pay in Spain too.

Focusing solely on LGBTQ+ communities, Spain is one of the most socially open and tolerant countries in the world, with one of the most advanced and extensive protections.
Even by liberal European standards, it is right on top!

Lol where do you see lower taxes? Btw americans always pay at LEAST the US taxes (as long as you make more than 80k or something like that), taxes for Americans abroad are always roughly the same as being back home. Now in europe and spain you can expect 10% higher taxes roughly speaking

I do this in Japan and it saves me a 15.3% every year. That said, the amount I pay into Japan's pension (required by law) is very low. Spain could be more than the US, but you won't have to pay both. If the US SS is cheaper than your resident country's, and there is a totalization agreement, you would save money by claiming an exemption.

Foreign earned income is income you receive for performing personal services in a foreign country. Where or how you are paid has no effect on the source of the income. For example, income you receive for work done in France is income from a foreign source even if the income is paid directly to your bank account in the United States and your employer is in New York City.

If you are Queer, Spain is by-far one of the best places to go in the EU, they are extremely LGBTQ+ friendly there

Americans living abroad get some exclusion on income tax, 110k a year or so, still quite significant, but then it’s hard to be eligible for Backham tax in Spain on DNV. Usually you just need to pay standard Spanish tax then get credits for US tax for the portion you’ve already paid.

Please do not. Valencia is going through a crazy housing crisis right now, in part due to the number of Americans buying up housing or outbidding locals for rent using money from their remote tech jobs. Multiple consultancies have popped up in the city hand holding American and British expats through this process. It is getting so acute that Spanish students are being hung up on when calling landlords and saying that they are studying at the local universities, which is ridiculous as Valencia is a major student town. Focus instead on what makes life so untenable in Chicago that you are considering uprooting to a completely new country with a new culture and language, and maybe look for more local alternatives instead.

I gave up everything to be here. I did not want to leave behind my family and everything I knew. Chicago is one city in America and there are many other liberal cities where moving there will not displace a native person. Stay back and fight for our rights instead of leaving the less fortunate behind to do it for you.

You certainly won’t be paying less taxes, that’s for sure. It’s a very slow and drawn out process between applying and successfully obtaining the TIE (Id) card.
The queer scene is different in Spain. In Valencia, the last few years the government is right wing and has attempted to cancel the parade. There is no “gay” district like in other cities.
Housing is very expensive here for what you get and increases on the daily because the landlords here demand multiple months up front and some tech workers can afford that.

Valencia and Malaga are both good picks. Both are LGBTQ+ friendly cities. Spain in general is pretty accepting.The visa process is manageable but slow. Spanish bureaucracy takes time. Getting your NIE is the first big step and it can take weeks to get an appointment. Banking is also tricky, some banks are easier than others for foreigners. Taxes are complicated as an American. You file in both countries. Get professional help with this part. Don't try to figure it out alone. My suggestion, talk to a visa specialist before you start. Most offer free consultations. They'll explain exactly what you need and how long it really takes.

You can take FEIE if you stay out of the US for 330 days starting last March, as long as you've hit the 330 days before you file your taxes. So you should be fine if you are out of the US.

You think that Croatia doesn't tax you on foreign income (because the company is in the US) and you don't have to pay taxes in the US because you were in Croatia when you made it so it's foreign income there too?

I'm Canadian, but I got the visa. I was already here on a student visa and I speak Spanish, so the transition wasn't too hard. There are a couple Facebook groups that can guide you through the whole process.
If you speak Spanish it is relatively easy. You need some documents translated by an official translator, but you can find those online before starting. Valencia is not my favourite city though, seems overrated now. I liked Malaga, but the beaches aren't the nicest.
