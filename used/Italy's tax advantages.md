# What are the tax incentives for new residents?

Summary:
Italy offers new residents—especially remote workers, retirees, and entrepreneurs—multiple tax incentive regimes. The headline benefits include a flat tax regime for high-net-worth individuals on foreign-sourced income, a reduced flat tax for retirees, and a low-rate “forfettario” for small business owners and freelancers.

Benefit stack:

- Flat tax option on foreign income (now €200,000, rising to €300,000) for 15 years
- 7% flat tax for foreign retirees relocating to select Southern towns (10 years)
- “Forfettario” regime: 5%–15% flat tax rate for freelancers/small businesses (up to €85,000 of income)
- No need to report foreign earnings individually if using the flat tax regime
- Separate €25,000 flat tax for each family member included
- Double-taxation treaties help expats avoid paying twice on the same income
- Significant exemptions available for workers moving jobs into Italy
- Clear annual reporting; most regimes don’t require prior Italian tax residency for eligibility

Micro social pack:
Hook:
New residents: pay flat tax, skip the paperwork.

Supporting line:
Italy wants you and your money—no reporting, no hassle, just pay your fixed fee.

Social benefits:

- Flat tax on overseas earnings
- Super-low rates for freelancers
- Major perks for retirees
- Bring the family, one fee per person
- Escape double taxation with treaties
