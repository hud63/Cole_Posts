# LinkedIn Post: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency

**40,000+ applications in 18 months: Saudi Arabia's residency gold rush is just getting started**

One stat caught my attention this week: Saudi Arabia's Premium Residency program drew 40,163 applications between January 2024 and July 2025, with 8,074 permits issued in 2024 alone.

This isn't just growth—it's a fundamental shift in global mobility patterns. For the first time, Saudi Arabia is opening residency pathways for foreign real estate investors and high-skilled professionals outside the traditional sponsorship system.

The numbers tell the story of what smart investors want: stability, freedom, and access to emerging markets.

Here's why this program is attracting global attention:

**1/ The "Exceptional Competence" category dominated with 5,578 permits issued.**
Saudi Arabia is specifically targeting high-performing professionals and executives with salary thresholds from $4,000 for researchers to $21,000 for senior executives. They're not just accepting anyone—they're curating talent that aligns with Vision 2030's economic transformation goals.

**2/ Foreign residents represent over 75% of Saudi's workforce, creating a massive internal market.**
With more than 40% of the population being foreign residents, many are converting from restrictive work visas to Premium Residency for one reason: freedom from sponsorship requirements. This eliminates the traditional kafala system constraints that have limited mobility and investment options for decades.

**3/ Property ownership restrictions are being eliminated by 2026.**
Currently, only Saudi nationals and Premium Residency holders can own real estate. But Saudi Arabia plans to open its property market to all foreigners within two years, potentially creating unprecedented demand for both residency status and real estate investment.

**4/ The program offers genuine economic freedoms rarely seen in the region.**
Premium Residency holders enjoy exemption from expatriate levies, unrestricted entry and exit, and the ability to work, invest, and own property without requiring local sponsorship. This level of economic autonomy is transforming Saudi Arabia from a temporary work destination into a permanent residence option.

The timing isn't coincidental. As traditional residency programs face increasing scrutiny and costs rise globally, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as an accessible alternative with genuine economic substance.

Real estate agent Mohammed AlWahhabi noted that applicants are "seeking stability, freedom from sponsorship, and better living conditions for their families"—exactly what today's mobile professionals prioritize.
