Hi everyone, welcome back to another video. My name is Courtney and on this channel I'm documenting my process of getting my German citizenship through descent and moving abroad next year in 2026. So if that sounds like something you're interested in following along for, definitely go ahead and hit subscribe. (00:28) In today's video, I want to explore how much it actually cost me to apply for my German citizenship through descent. So, if you are somebody who's wanting to apply for citizenship through descent for any country really, this would probably apply for you as well. So, you can just have an idea of how much it might cost you in the long run. (00:46) In general, the process is free. applying for it was free. But if you are someone like me who did not have any of the original documents on hand and needed to source them and order them, um it does end up kind of costing a lot. Now, at the time of applying, I was not planning on making a YouTube channel talking about this. (01:08) I was not, you know, there was no reason for me to keep track of how much everything cost. So, I did have to go back and do research and dig through my email, which I had cleaned out. So, it wasn't very easy. I have a pretty good guess of how much it all cost. So, right here you can see all of the different tasks that I had written down that I needed to accomplish in order to submit my application. (01:29) This includes different things like, you know, creating copies of my personal documents and sourcing documents that would cost me money in the long run. So, this was made on Air Table, but if I were to go back in time, I would use notion instead. And I made a free template if you want something like this, but in notion it's in the description box. (01:51) You can just copy it to your notion dashboard and hopefully that will help you keep track of everything because this was a lifesaver for me and I'm a big proponent on keeping things organized when going through this process. So let's start with the basics. The very first expense I had to make was buying stamps. (02:09) So yes, I'm including this because I would not have had to buy stamps for any other reason aside for this. So, that probably cost around $16. I don't think I paid more than that for the stamps. Then, I had to get the FBI wrap report. And this includes getting your fingerprints done. And I had no idea how much this cost. (02:28) So, it cost me $50 to get my fingerprints done. And because I did this uh physically, I ended up mailing it in instead of doing it electronically. My sheet ended up costing $12 for it to be printed plus tax. So that was $62. And then to request the report, that costs $18 to the FBI. So that brings our total to $80 for that. (02:55) And then I had to request my dad's long birth certificate. So if you are unsure what that is, like I was, it basically is literally a long birth certificate. It has a lot more information. The birth certificate that my dad had on hand was very basic. It had like three lines on it. I was shocked to see that. So, this whole process was about 2 years ago, so it's hard to exactly remember what I was doing in order to get all of these fees, but I know I ordered duplicates of almost everything because I just in case something got lost before I was (03:29) submitting it or maybe when I submitted it, I wanted to keep a copy for myself. I usually did order two. So, this shows that the order that I made to the vital records for his birth certificate was a total of $56.80 because I paid for US Air to ship it kind of fast. But I'm not sure why I had another order of $41.80. (03:53) Maybe I didn't receive the first one, so I ordered a second one. I'm not sure, but this is what I had in my email. So, that brings us to $98.60. 60s. The next thing that I had to do was order my great-grandfather's birth certificate and he was from Carl'sbad, Germany. Because he was born over 100 years ago, his birth certificate was in an archive, which must have made it easier for them to find it or something because this process was really easy for the most part. So, that cost $17. (04:25) 50, which ended up being $19.24. But because I was not familiar at the time with how bank transfers work internationally, and I assumed my only option was to wire the money through my personal bank, which has a $50 transfer fee internationally. So, I did it. I ended up paying $69.24 just for this $17 document. (04:52) The people at my bank thought I was insane. If you're going through this process, please do not make that same mistake I did because there's a company called Wise that I use now where you can transfer money internationally with like the smallest fee ever. So, if you're going through this process, click that link in my description box. (05:09) I think that link gives you up to like $500 transferred with no fees. So, that is amazing. I could have done that for free. Then I had to get my greatgrandfather's marriage certificate from the New York City clerk. And this is these are the kind of things that were way harder for me than just reaching out to the German town halls and getting the documents. (05:33) I felt like New York City was the hardest and took the longest surprisingly. But for some reason, my great-grandfather um and my great-grandmother got married in the Bronx when they lived in Germany. They had a destination wedding in the Bronx. I guess it cost $30 for the marriage record as well as $4 for the shipping for the document. (05:57) So that came to $34. And then I had to get my grandmother's first marriage certificate. So this costs $35 for the initial copy and then $30 for any additional copies, which again, I did definitely get the additional copy, which would be about $65. And then because my grandmother ended up getting divorced from my dad's dad, I needed to get some sort of proof of why her last name was not his last name anymore. (06:26) So, I had to get divorce papers. And this part was tricky. Heads up, if you're going through this process, you have to know the town that these events happen in. And where I live, like there's so many little hamlets everywhere. So, I had to reach out to all of these different people. They're like, "They weren't divorced here. (06:45) They weren't married here." So, it was really like a detective mission or something trying to figure this out. So, if you are somebody who has to get divorce papers or anything like that, I'm going to share with you what I was told just in case that's helpful. Um, so one of the responses I received was, "Good morning. The clerk can only provide a certificate of disposition. (07:08) You don't need authorization for this. If you need a certified cop, you would need notorized consent from one of the parties or a court order. And I was so confused about that because they're both dead. And why would I need a court order for that? So, I said, I believe a certificate of disposition is fine. (07:25) How can I go about receiving that? You would send a letter to the county clerk requesting a certificate of disposition for that case. The fee is $5. But I also had reached out to other towns requesting this, requesting that they search for this. Um, and one of them says that it was $11 for them to do that. That wasn't the right place. (07:42) So, that cost me $11 plus $5 for the other town that I went through. So, that's $16 because I didn't know where to search. So, then I had to get my grandmother's marriage certificate for her second husband to show again why her last name was different. And to do this, I had to show a copy of my birth certificate and a copy of my father's birth certificate to prove that uh she was his mom. (08:06) And that's why I needed access to this document. And the fee for this was $10 per certified copy, but I had to get a notorized copy of my photo ID. And I don't remember if that would cost anything to get it notorized, but I'm going to throw in an extra $5 just to say maybe it did on top of the $10 certified check. (08:28) Next, I had to get my grandmother's long birth certificate from Carl's Route, Germany. And this was the hardest document for me to receive. I even doing the research in my own email research on myself. I could not figure out exactly what happened. So, I'm going to walk through my notes and try to explain what happened and why I ended up paying what I did. (08:50) So, I went to submit my request for this document. And it was $40 for two copies cuz I know I definitely was requesting two certified copies, which would have been $46.50. 58. Again, I can't remember the exact details, but I know I was having issues with that because I think I got an email saying that they don't have her birth certificate. (09:13) So, I found this email that kind of explains what was happening and I sent this to somebody in her town. So, I said, "Hello, I'm in need of help. I don't speak German and I'm really struggling to get through the process. I felt like everything was getting lost in translation. I'm trying to order my grandmother's birth certificate. She's no longer living. (09:32) I originally ordered a copy of her birth certificate from Derlock Carl's room where I believed she was born. Derlock said they didn't have her birth certificate. I then received an email that they had found the birth certificate, but that I needed to provide a wire transfer for it, but I had already paid. (09:48) I don't know at this point if that birth certificate has been mailed to me. But regardless, I just tried to order it from your website and I don't understand. It says I need a power of attorney. I don't understand why I need a power of attorney when my grandmother's no longer alive and I didn't need it when I previously applied. So that's what had happened. (10:08) I had ordered it. They didn't have it, but I had already paid for it. And then I had to pay a wire transfer to get the copy that they said they were going to send me. I never needed to end up getting a power of attorney. So I don't really know what that was about. But basically, I ended up going to my bank the same day as the other document and paying the wire transfer fee again. (10:32) So, in order to get my grandmother's birth certificate, for whatever reason, I had to pay another $12 for it, which is about $14 plus the $50 wire transfer fee again, which is $64 on top of the 40 something that I already had paid. So, I was very frustrated about this whole process cuz nobody was like in sync. Like people were telling me different things and I was trying to be calm and trying to be respectful and trying to speak in German as often as I could, but I was just like everything is getting lost in translation here. So, I ended up (11:08) paying everything and the funny thing is I ended up receiving my grandmother's birth certificate in the mail and then like 2 days later I ended up getting two more copies of it. I was like, "Wait, what? Why did I just get three copies of her birth certificate? I don't know." So, that was frustrating. That definitely took the longest. (11:26) Then, I had to get a copy of my mom and dad's marriage certificate. I couldn't find proof of this in my emails, but I did send a letter with a certified check to the town they were married in, which would have cost maybe $12. Then, I needed to get the certificate of non-existence, and thankfully, at the time, it was free. (11:48) Now, it's saying that it costs $280 for this document. Oh, if that's if you do it online. If you're doing a paper filing fee, it's $330. So, keep that in mind. I was really lucky. At the time, it was free. I also wanted to calculate the trains that I took to the consulate and the taxis or Ubers that I took while I was down there. (12:12) I went twice to the consulate, so I'm going to estimate that to be around $300 for the train tickets with some Ubers and taxis. And finally, I'm adding in the research tools that I use because I would not have been able to do this without ancestry.com. That was life-saving. I had to, you know, figure out the exact towns that these people were born in, even down to the district that my grandmother was born in, which I'm pretty sure it was Durlock. (12:40) So, I don't know why I was being told it wasn't there. You know, I was able to find through the census documents and things like that, like the exact addresses that they lived at. It was really, really cool. So, I'm really grateful that I had access to the Ancestry Worldwide subscription for at least 6 months at the time. I think I did, which would have been around $250. (12:59) And I remember I did sign up for My Heritage at one point and I did sign up for another indexing company because they had a document that I needed to see. Um, so I'm just going to guess that would have been another $160, which would have totaled to $412. So with all of that said, let's go ahead and add it all up. (13:24) I actually can't believe it costs this much. That is crazy. It's definitely because of the bank transfer fees. That was my mistake. I should not have done that. Use Wise. Please use Wise. And then the whole issue with my grandmother's birth certificate. And then my dad's birth certificate. I don't think I received it and I had to do another one. (13:42) But the total of how much it cost me to apply for my German citizenship through descent is $1,226.52. That's actually a lot. But I've said this before, it definitely didn't feel like it was that much because it was spread out over probably six months or so. So if we divide that by six, that's about $200ish a month. (14:08) So it wasn't all at once. But it's just funny that it ended up costing over $1,000 when it's technically free to apply. If you have all of the documents, that is amazing. You are so lucky. So yeah. Did you expect it to be lower than this or did you expect it to be higher than this? I am so curious. And if you applied for your citizenship, let me know in the comments how much you think it cost you to apply. (14:36) And again, if you are needing help with your citizenship application or if you are wondering if you're eligible, I am offering some help. I loved doing this process for myself. It was so fun and I love doing the research. So, if you want somebody to help you out, you can check the link in the description box for ways that I can help you. (14:53) Thank you so much for watching. Give this video a thumbs up if you want to see more like this, and I will see you next week with another video. Bye. \[Music\]"
