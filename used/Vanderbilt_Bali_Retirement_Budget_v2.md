...especially if you move abroad. 

The options I'll show you prove that a fulfilling retirement is possible on a modest budget.

Number one is Bali.

Bali offers tropical retirement living at a fraction of Western costs
because you can enjoy hotel-style accommodations
with breakfast and pool access for $400/month,
fortnightly massages for $10,
and restaurant meals for under $5.

With utilities at just $80 monthly and groceries 20% cheaper than US prices at local markets, your budget covers gym memberships ($25), regular dining out, and transportation via Grab rides or scooter rentals at $80/month plus $20 fuel.
