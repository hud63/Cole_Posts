Expats relocating from the U.S. to warmer climates often put Costa Rica and Panama at the top of their list. And for good reason — both offer warm climates, stunning natural beauty, and thriving expat communities. In fact, it can be hard to decide which tropical nation will be the best for your new home. So we’ve pitted them head to head in a competition over climate, cost of living, healthcare, the ease of gaining residency, and how welcoming the locals are likely to be to you as an expat. Which country will come out ahead?

Neither, obviously — the best country for you depends entirely on your priorities, preferences, resources, and needs. But this head-to-head might help.

Climate

Costa Rica: Costa Rica’s diverse geography means diverse weather patterns. You’ll find hot and humid weather along the coastline, milder weather around the Central Valley (where San José is located), and cooler weather in the mountainous areas to the north.

Panama: Panama tends to be more uniformly hot and humid overall than Costa Rica. You’ll find the warmest, stickiest weather around Panama City, and a cooler, more temperate relief from the heat in mountain towns like Boquete.

Advantage: Tie, depending on your weather preferences.

Cost of Living

Costa Rica: The cost of living can rival U.S. prices when you get to popular expat hubs like Escazú or Tamarindo, particularly for housing and transportation. But many expats can live comfortably on a more modest budget in smaller towns.

Panama: Once you get outside Panama City, the cost of living is slightly lower than in Costa Rica. You’ll generally find affordable housing, lower utility costs, and reasonably priced groceries and services in smaller cities and rural areas.

Advantage: Panama, for general affordability and for variety of options.

Healthcare

Costa Rica: Costa Rica has a strong public healthcare system. Residents — including expats with legal status — are required to enroll and pay a monthly fee, but they get access to healthcare at low or no additional cost. Beyond the public system, private providers also offer high-quality care at reasonable prices.

Panama: Panama’s healthcare system functions much like Costa Rica’s, although residents aren’t required to enroll. Quality of care is strong, particularly in Panama City and larger towns, although accessibility may be limited when you get outside of urban areas.

Advantage: Tie, particularly when you compare them to the cost of healthcare in the U.S.

Ease of Gaining Residency

Costa Rica: Costa Rica offers a Pensionado visa for retirees, a visa for the independently wealthy, a visa for digital nomads, and an Inversionista visa for investors. The process is rather involved — you have to start by applying at your nearest Costa Rican consulate, each of which can have a slightly different procedure, and then travel to Costa Rica on a provisional visa to complete the process, which has many further steps.

Panama: Panama offers — among other options — a Pensionado visa for retirees, a golden visa available via investment, and a Friendly Nations visa that offers a relatively fast track to residency for citizens of qualified countries (including the U.S.).

Advantage: Panama, for ease and efficiency.

Friendliness to Expats

Costa Rica: Costa Rica has a longstanding reputation for being warm and friendly, and locals tend to be experienced at interacting with foreigners. English is widely spoken in expat-heavy areas (which is not to say you shouldn’t learn Spanish anyway).

Panama: Panama is home to diverse communities of retirees, remote workers, resident expats, and locals, particularly in areas like Boquete and Coronado. Panamanians are generally friendly and accommodating.

Advantage: Tie. Costa Rica’s more laid-back national attitude can give it a more welcoming air, but if you’re a nice, respectful person, you’ll find friendly faces on both sides of the border.
