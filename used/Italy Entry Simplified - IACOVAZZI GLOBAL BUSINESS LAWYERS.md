## Who this is for

Foreign founders, CFOs, and in-house counsel evaluating **how** to establish a presence in Italy for sales, projects, or hiring must consider the implications of Italian Market Entry 2025: SRL vs. Branch Explained.

## In brief (2 minutes)

- **[SRL (subsidiary)](https://italianbusinesslawyers.com/italian-company-formation/limited-liability-company-srl/)** offers limited liability and complete operational freedom; expect more setup formalities but cleaner risk separation.
- **[Branch](https://italianbusinesslawyers.com/open-a-branch-in-italy/)** is faster to start than an SRL but exposes the **parent** to liabilities and Italian tax nexus for local activities.
- **[Representative Office](https://italianbusinesslawyers.com/open-representative-office-italy/)** is the lightest footprint for **non‑commercial** activity only (marketing, liaison, research) — no invoicing.
- If you will **invoice, hire, or hold contracts in Italy**, you generally need an **SRL** or a **Branch**.
- Use our **5‑question decision tree** below to choose, then book a feasibility call.

## Comparison table — SRL vs Branch vs Representative Office

---

| Factor | SRL (Subsidiary) | Branch of Foreign Company | Representative Office |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Legal personality | Separate Italian company | Same legal entity as the parent | No legal personality |
| Liability | Limited to the SRL’s assets | Parent remains fully liable | N/A (no commercial activity) |
| Corporate income tax presence | In Italy (on SRL profits) | In Italy (on profits attributable to Italian permanent establishment) | None (no commercial income) |
| VAT position | Own VAT number | Parent’s Italian VAT position (via branch) | Not eligible for VAT registration |
| Activity scope | Full commercial operations | Full commercial operations | Non‑commercial (liaison/marketing) |
| Governance | Directors; shareholders; local corporate books | Branch representative; parent governance applies | Local representative |
| Banking | Own Italian bank account | Local bank account in branch’s name | Not usually required |
| Capital | Flexible; typically set to signal substance | No capital; parent funds branch | Not applicable |
| Setup & formalities | Incorporation before notary; CCIAA registration | Branch registration of parent docs; CCIAA | Simple registration/notification (varies) |
| Ongoing compliance | Full bookkeeping, corporate filings, payroll if hiring | Italian bookkeeping for branch, filings | Minimal (no accounts if no costs beyond liaison) |
| Perception with clients/banks | High credibility; easier vendor onboarding | Medium; depends on counterparty policies | Low for contracting; cannot sign commercial deals |

> **Tip:** If you need **procurement eligibility, [public tenders](https://italianbusinesslawyers.com/practice-areas/italian-tenders-procurements/) or complex client onboarding**, an **SRL** is typically the least resisted path.

## Typical documents you’ll need (checklist)

---

- Parent company **certificate of incorporation** and **good standing** (apostilled + translated for Branch/RO).
- **Board/shareholder resolutions** authorising the Italian setup and appointing a local representative.
- **Passport/ID** and **tax codes** for directors/representatives.
- **Registered office** address and **service agreement** (virtual office ok for many use cases).
- **Bank KYC** pack and proof of funds (SRL).
- **Articles of Association** (SRL) aligned to your governance and future investment plans.

---

## Common pitfalls (and how to avoid them)

---

- **Under‑capitalised SRL** → sets off bank/KYC friction and weak vendor confidence. **Fix:** set a sensible capital and prepare a business plan summary.
- **Branch without risk analysis** → parent fully exposed; transfer pricing overlooked. **Fix:** PE/profit attribution memo and group policies.
- **Using a Representative Office to “test sales”** → high risk of reclassification. **Fix:** keep strictly non‑commercial and document scope.

---

## Implementation roadmap (30/60/90 days)

---

**Day 0–30:** structure selection, name check, draft Articles/resolutions, office address, notary booking, bank pre‑work.  
**Day 31–60:** incorporation/registration (or branch filing), VAT, social security/INPS/INAIL if hiring, open bank account.  
**Day 61–90:** first invoices/contracts, payroll setup, H&S baseline (POS/PaC if construction), compliance calendar.

---

## FAQs

---

**Is a Representative Office allowed to invoice?**  
No. It is limited to non‑commercial liaison/marketing activities.

**Can a Branch hire employees?**  
Yes. A Branch can hire and run payroll; ensure HR and H&S compliance is in place.

**What capital is required for an SRL?**  
Italian law allows flexible capital; many groups choose a pragmatic amount to support banking and vendor onboarding.

**When do we create a permanent establishment (PE)?**  
A Branch or an operating SRL is by definition Italian‑taxable; a Representative Office must avoid commercial activity to avoid PE risk.

**Can we convert a Branch into an SRL later?**  
Yes, plan for contract/staff transfer and tax step‑up where relevant.

**How long does setup take?**  
Timelines vary by city/bank. Expect faster registration for Branch/RO; SRL adds incorporation steps.
