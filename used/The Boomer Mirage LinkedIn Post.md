**From 52% to 13%: The chart that reveals America's greatest theft**

One chart stopped me cold this week. In 1950, over half of 30-year-olds were married homeowners. By 2025, analysts project that number as low as 13%.

That's not cultural change. That's systematic extraction disguised as progress.

The post-WWII boom created perfect conditions: cheap energy, falling interest rates from 18% to 2.6%, and home prices at 2-3x annual income. Boomers rode a 40-year tailwind that inflated their assets while deflating their debt.

Today's reality is brutal. Home prices now run 5-6x annual income while rates can only rise from historic lows. The math quietly stopped working, but the illusion had to be maintained.

Here's what really happened:

**1/ The extraction became digital and global.**
As the American Dream died, stablecoins emerged to serve 400 million users globally. Where boomers got real assets with privacy, younger generations get digital "assets" with total surveillance. It's the same extraction model, just scaled and digitized.

**2/ Housing markets reveal the systematic pricing-out.**  
Recent data shows over 500,000 more sellers than buyers—not because homes are affordable, but because an entire generation has been systematically excluded. The demand exists, but the purchasing power has been systematically destroyed.

**3/ Institutions mutated from service to extraction.**
Education, finance, and government still speak the old language but serve a different purpose: keeping people compliant in a system that no longer offers a way out. They sell empowerment while removing agency.

**4/ The surveillance trade-off is particularly insidious.**
Digital financial systems offer less monitoring than banks initially, but once everyone's locked in, controls become unprecedented. Every transaction trackable, every account freezable, every participant manageable.

The good news? Once you see the rigged game, you stop competing for scraps and start building something real.

The chart that documents the death of the old dream becomes the blueprint for actual sovereignty—if we're honest enough to read what it's telling us.
