Trentino is doubling down on its bold plan to breathe new life into sparsely populated mountain villages. After a hugely popular first call in May 2025, a second round of applications opens 8 September and runs until 23 October 2025. This initiative – backed by a €10 million fund (split equally between 2025 and 2026) – offers generous grants to encourage people to buy and renovate homes in 32 remote comuni (municipalities) at risk of depopulation. Below, we explain how the scheme works, what happened in the first round, and why these alpine hamlets are attracting interest from young locals and even a few adventurous expats.

€100k To Move to Trentino: Terms and Conditions

The region around Trento is known as some of the most efficient and desirable in Italy, with property prices to match. However, remote valleys and small towns in the area have been suffering from dwindling population for years, causing local administrators to build a “move to Trentino” fund.

The “revitalization” programme provides grants up to €80,000 for property renovations, covering  40% of costs in historic centres (35% in other areas). If you need to purchase a house, 20% of the buying price can be subsidised (capped at an eligible cost of €100,000, i.e. max €20k grant). The goal is to make it financially viable to restore old homes in villages that have seen better days. However, this isn’t a free-for-all – there are strict criteria and strings attached:

Who can apply: Only private individuals (not companies) can benefit. Applicants must already be (or become within 6 months) the owner or holder of rights to a property in one of the designated comuni. Each person may tackle up to  three housing units, but  at least one must become a prima casa  – a primary residence for the owner or a tenant –  not a holiday home. The  new residents must live in (or rent out) the home for at least 10 years following the project.
Age and residency conditions: The scheme aims to entice new  and younger residents. If an applicant is  over 45 years old and intends to use the home as their own primary residence, they must not already reside in that same village (as of August 2024). In practice, this encourages newcomers or former residents returning, rather than people who are already locals simply upgrading a second home.
Property restrictions: The property itself can’t be a luxury or oversized holiday villa. Homes classified as luxury residences (categ. A1), castles (A9) or villas (A8) are excluded, and the building can’t have more than 8 units or be part of a big condominium. This targets the aid to genuinely modest village houses.
No double dipping: To avoid abuse, you can’t combine this grant with any other public funding or tax bonuses for the same renovation. And once you get the money, you have  24 months to complete the works and submit all invoices – it’s use it or lose it.
Eligible works: The funds can cover a wide range of restoration work – from fixing roofs, walls, doors and windows to installing plumbing, heating (minus solar panels), wiring, and other internal improvements. Both interior and exterior refurbishment is supported, with a small allowance for technical expenses like architects or engineers (up to 10% of the project cost). Notably, the grant can even partially cover the purchase of the property itself, as mentioned, but  only if the sale isn’t between close relatives, and  you cannot get a grant solely to buy without doing any renovation. Essentially, it’s about bringing new life to old houses –  you can buy an old home and fix it up, but you must actually fix it up.

How to apply: Applications are submitted online through the province’s portal (the “Stanza del cittadino”), and the process is competitive but also time-sensitive. In fact, applications are processed in order of arrival – a bit like a click-day – with priority given to projects involving historic-centre buildings, first homes, and under-45 applicants. This prompted a rush in the first round (more on that shortly). The second round now opening in September is the last chance for 2025 funds; two more rounds are expected in 2026.

Trentino’s €100k Grant: Which Towns Qualify

The following 32 municipalities are taking part in the scheme: Altavalle, Bleggio Superiore, Bondone, Borgo Chiese, Bresimo, Canal San Bovo, Castel Condino, Castello Tesino, Cis, Cinte Tesino, Dambel, Frassilongo, Grigno, Livo, Luserna, Mezzano, Novella, Ospedaletto, Peio, Pieve di Bono-Prezzo, Pieve Tesino, Rabbi, Rumo, Sagron Mis, Segonzano, Sover, Terragnolo, Tre Ville, Valdaone, Valfloriana, Vallarsa, Vermiglio.

Huge Interest in Trentino from Locals (and Some Expats)

Trentino’s Mountain Valley in a Wide View

The inaugural call (19 May – 30 June 2025) was met with overwhelming  interest. A total of 291 applications came in during that six-week window, far exceeding expectations. Provincial officials were thrilled, noting that  90% of applicants were Trentino residents (many from the same valleys as the target villages), and at least 80% were under 45 years old. This suggests the scheme struck a chord especially with younger locals – people willing to stay or move to the mountains if given a helping hand. “It shows that folks are ready to remain in peripheral areas if adequately supported,” commented housing councillor Simone Marchiori.

Not all interest came from locals, however. Two brave souls from abroad – one from Edinburgh and one from Brussels – also applied in the first round. It’s not clear which villages caught their eye, but the fact that a couple of international applicants threw their hat in the ring is remarkable. (They could be expatriate Trentini coming home, or simply foreigners enticed by the idea of an alpine escape subsidised by the government!). The remaining ~10% of applicants were mostly from other parts of northern Italy, especially neighbouring regions in the North-East.

So, which villages were people most keen on? The top picks were Val di Rabbi, Novella, and Mezzano. Rabbi – a high valley known for its pristine nature and thermal springs – led the pack with  30 requests  in the first round. (This included, reportedly, interest from as far away as Belgium, with one family ready to drive 700 km to resettle in Rabbi and renovate their grandparents’ old house!)  Novella, a cluster of hamlets in Val di Non, was close behind with  28 applications, and  Mezzano  in Primiero (a famously pretty village) drew  25 applications. Overall, 31 out of 32 eligible comuni saw at least some interest.

Given the avalanche of applications, the province has its hands full processing them. The first-come first-served system means some who applied moments after the portal opened were basically guaranteed, while latecomers may be on a waitlist.

Italy’s Mountain Towns: Staying Safe and Living Well

To keep things fair (and avoid purely speculative grabs), officials emphasise that grant recipients must make a significant private investment too – the provincial money is a boost, but not a free house. As President Fugatti noted, “alongside the public resources, the private individual is required to make an important commitment, not only financially but also in terms of engagement with the community”. In other words, moving to a remote village isn’t just a transaction – it’s a lifestyle decision.

Spotlight on 4 Qualifying Villages in Trentino: New Life in the Slow Lane

Which villages could soon see new faces and renovated homes? Trentino’s list of 32 comuni reads like a roll call of off-the-beaten-path Alpine hamlets – from tiny Luserna  on its high plateau, to  Canal San Bovo  in the wild Vanoi valley, to  Altavalle amid the Cembra wine hills. Many of these places are unknown even to Italians, but a few stand out as especially appealing to outsiders (expats, retirees or remote workers dreaming of la dolce vita in the mountains). Here are some highlights:

Of course, these are just a few examples. Other participating comuni each have their own character: Bleggio Superiore  in the Giudicarie has famous hazelnuts and proximity to Comano’s spa; Pieve Tesino  is the birthplace of a former Italian Prime Minister (and has a golf course nearby); Vermiglio  offers access to skiing and hiking around Passo Tonale; Vallarsa  in the Vicentine Alps is a haven for history buffs with its Great War trails – and so on. What they all share is a need for people. Many have only a few hundred residents left, mostly elderly, as young folks long ago left for the cities. The Trentino government’s bet is that, with some financial incentive, a new generation (and new families) might give these places a second chance.

Trentino vs. the Trend: A Demographic Bright Spot

Zooming out, why is Trentino doing this? In short, to combat Italy’s grave “demographic winter”. The whole country is aging and shrinking – 2024 saw only ~370,000 births nationwide (a record low, about 6.3 per thousand people), while deaths were around 650,000. Mountain and rural areas are hit hardest, as young people leave and birth rates plunge. But  Trentino stands out as a relative bright spot  in this winter. Thanks to years of family-friendly policies and its strong economy, Trentino’s  birth rate remains one of the highest in Italy (albeit still low by global standards).

In 2023 the province recorded 7 births per 1,000 inhabitants – above the national average of 6.4‰. Its people also live long, yet the death rate (9.5‰) in Trento province is significantly lower than Italy’s (~11.2‰) and even lower than the North-East region’s average. The net effect: Trentino’s natural population decline is much gentler than elsewhere. There were about 1,364 more deaths than births in 2023 – a negative population balance, but immigration more than compensated for it, resulting in a slight population growth of +4‰ that year. By contrast, many neighbouring areas (including parts of Veneto) have a far worse imbalance and are losing people faster. For example, the Veneto region saw roughly  30,000 births vs 50,000 deaths in a recent year, and provinces like Belluno face acute depopulation in their villages.

Birth and Death Rates in Italy and Selected Regions (latest data, 2023)

What Trentino is doing with this scheme is proactively leveraging its relative demographic strength to address weaker spots  – using provincial autonomy and funds to try to save the pockets that  are  declining. The provided map of birth-death ratios by region (which shows Trentino in a better position than most of Italy) underscores that  Trentino is faring better than neighbouring Veneto in keeping communities viable. While Veneto’s rural towns struggle with dwindling youth and closures, Trentino is upping the ante with substantial grants.

A Model for Others? Veneto Dealing with Population Decline

Trentino’s initiative has drawn national and even international attention, raising the question: Could this be a model for other regions? The concept of paying people to move to depopulated areas isn’t entirely new – we’ve heard of €1 houses in , or remote villages in the south offering cash bonuses for new babies. But Trentino’s programme is unique in its scale and coordination. It’s a province-wide plan, well-funded and with clear rules, targeting multiple villages at once.

Early indicators suggest it’s working (at least in generating interest and applications). Officials in other mountainous regions are taking note: for instance, leaders in Italy’s mountainous Belluno (Veneto) have openly said they “need similar measures here too”, and Confindustria (the business federation) in Belluno has urged the government to consider Trentino-like housing incentives in the Dolomites. Even outside Italy, the story of “Trentino paying people up to €100k to move in” made headlines, as many countries face rural depopulation issues.

That said, it’s not a simple formula one can copy-paste. Trentino has advantages that helped make this scheme viable: financial autonomy to allocate millions to a social experiment, and a relatively well-off population ready to co-invest in renovations. Other regions might struggle to find the funds or may lack interested locals to take up the offer. The long-term success  of Trentino’s approach will also be measured not just by applications, but by outcomes: Will those 291 (and counting) applicants actually follow through, complete their projects, and settle in these villages for the long haul? Will we see  babies  born in these villages, schools reopening or at least not closing? Those are answers only time will provide. and, as we learned in the 1 euro homes case, getting headlines and succeeding in getting people to move are two different things.

What’s clear for now is that Trentino has decided not to sit idly by as villages empty out. The second round of the scheme, opening this September 2025, aims to keep the momentum going. Provincial authorities have even hinted that if demand stays high, they might allocate extra resources to ensure all good projects get funded. By the end of 2026, we could witness dozens of formerly abandoned houses across Trentino being lived in and cared for –  a tangible reversal of decline. In a country where news on the demographic front is usually pessimistic, this is a refreshingly hopeful development.

In sum, the Magic Towns of Trentino are getting a new lease on life. Whether you’re a young Trentino local yearning to fix up the family home, an expat dreaming of an alpine retirement, or a remote worker seeking a mountain base – this scheme is an invitation to be part of a community revival. Other regions will be watching closely, and perhaps taking notes.
