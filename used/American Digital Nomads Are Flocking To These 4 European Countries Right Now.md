Tired of the polarizing politics and elevated cost of living at home? You're not alone: this year, a growing number of Americans are contemplating a move abroad, and naturally, Europe is what they've set their hearts on.

The continent of fairytale castles, cultural wealth, and slower-paced living, it's never sounded more appealing to the odd U.S. citizen looking to escape the daily grind.

It's no surprise, then, that digital nomads based in the United States are flocking to EU nations that have flung the doors open to them, be it through Digital Nomad Visas, or Citizenship by Investment programs:

Where Are Americans Going?

There are a number of European countries making it easier for Americans to emigrate and set up a permanent base across the pond.

Noteworthy examples are Georgia and Albania, which famously allow Americans to stay for an uninterrupted full year as visitors. For most countries, however, emigrating isn't as simple: there are visa requirements and financial thresholds to be met, and applications can take time.

If we're talking the much-coveted European Union, which neither Georgia nor Albania is a member of, that's when migration routes start looking a little trickier… though not exactly impossible.

According to the latest Expatsi ranking, which compiled country preferences of roughly 13,000 respondents, Americans have 4 EU hotspots on their radar, and perhaps unsurprisingly, they all currently welcome qualified expats with open arms:

Greece

Coming in fourth on Expatsi’s list, Greece is a dream for nomads who love island-hopping, geek out over ancient history, and crave a relaxed Mediterranean lifestyle.

The capital and largest city, Athens, is a promising expat hub known for its affordability, youthful energy, and plethora of sidewalk cafes, where you're more than welcome to get your laptop out as you sip your morning cappuccino freddo.

Nomads have also been gathering in places like Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest urban center, and Heraklion, the capital of Crete, and a more laid-back alternative to the mainland cities. Overall, the cost of living is markedly lower than in many Western European hubs.

According to Numbeo, rent in Athens is on average 58.3% cheaper than in Paris, and you can eat a lavish meal in a downtown restaurant for around $17.34.

How To Qualify For Greece's Digital Nomad Visa

Minimum monthly income: €3,500 after tax. If bringing a spouse, the requirement increases to €4,200. With each additional dependent, you should add €525 per month
Proof of remote work: you must be able to demonstrate you are employed remotely, or that you have signed freelance contracts with companies based outside Greece
Health insurance: taking out health insurance is mandatory, and it must be valid for the entirety of your planned stay in Greece
Criminal record: You must not have been convicted of serious offenses in your home country, and you may be asked to provide a clean record
Application: documents must be submitted at a Greek consulate or embassy in your home country prior to the planned relocation
Validity period: 2 years, renewable as long as you continue to fulfill the initial requirements

Italy

At number three, we have the darling of pasta and wine-loving Americans. The delicious food and ancient allure are good enough reasons to relocate to Italy, but what the country truly excels at is its plethora of gorgeous, culture-loaded cities:

From the timeless streets of Rome, to the Renaissance palaces of Florence, to the winding canals of Venice, your new home could look like a literal open-air museum—and the best part is, you don't have to go broke for soaking up all this Old World charm.

In Rome, renting a one-bedroom apartment outside the city center will set you back  $912.76 per month on average, though you can get it for much cheaper in Catania, a  sprawling metropolis in the south of Sicily, where rooms cost $343.75 per month.

Prices vary wildly across Italy, and usually the more developed North (and Rome) is a more expensive destination, whereas the south is generally cheaper to live in, particularly Calabria.

Spain

The second-highest ranking European country on Expatsi's list, Spain is luring hundreds of thousands of American expats with its pleasant weather, affordable living, and ease of integration.

When it comes to city options, some of the most obvious choices are Madrid, the elegant Spanish capital, Barcelona, best known for its innovative Gaudí architecture and coastal atmosphere, and the up-and-coming Seville, recently named the best city in Europe.

More recently, other fast-rising nomad hubs in Spain include Palma de Mallorca, a cathedral city in the paradisaical namesake island, Tenerife, a vibrant seaside getaway out in the Canaries, and even Bilbao, a fast-growing metropolis in the much-overlooked north of Spain.

The cost of living in Spain has been on the rise, like pretty much everywhere else, but you can still live comfortably on under $3,500-a-month in over 10 locations, as seen on Nomad List.

Portugal

Finishing No. 1 in the ranking, Portugal was the best match for Americans who took the ‘Expatsi Test', which matches users to countries based on their relocation preferences, and we mean, can you blame them?

We'd move halfway across the world for Porto wine alone.

Jokes aside, Lisbon has established itself as a European magnet for digital nomads, and quite honestly, what's not to like? It has the sunny weather, the delicious pasteis de nata, the postcard-ready streets, and even cute yellow vintage trams!

Porto, in the north of Portugal, is yet another strong contender for nomads based in Portugal: picture a scenic riverfront, a well-preserved historic center dotted with Baroque churches, and a plethora of family-owned eateries serving salted Portuguese bacalhau the traditional way.

Budget-wise, a month in most Portuguese cities will run you up under $3,000, based on Nomad List estimates, with the exception of Lisbon, where the monthly average expenses total $3,827.
