Another option is to apply in person through a [El Salvadoran consulate or embassy abroad](https://rree.gob.sv/embajadas-consulados-y-misiones-permanentes-de-la-republica-de-el-salvador/). Note that you’ll have to contact the authorities of the office you want to visit to make an appointment. You can’t just walk in.

## My Tax Perspective on the El Salvador Nomad Visa

You become a tax resident of El Salvador if you meet one of the following criteria:

- Have your main source of income in El Salvador
- Spend more than 200 consecutive days in the country during a calendar year

As the digital nomad visa only let’s you work for foreign employers or clients, you won’t meet the first criteria. Nevertheless, you could still meet the second condition.

**However, qualifying as a tax resident of El Salvador isn’t necessarily a bad thing because El Salvador applies a [territorial tax system](https://digitalnomadtax.eu/territorial-tax-system-countries/). Accordingly, you only pay tax on local source income (with some exceptions).**

Furthermore, El Salvador is interesting for crypto investors. Capital gains on cryptocurrencies remain tax free and Bitcoin is accepted as legal tender.

**Moreover, El Salvador explicitly exempts nomad visa holders from income taxes.**

## How is Life in El Salvador for Digital Nomads

If you’re considering to apply for the El Salvador digital nomad visa, you need to know the following things:

- **Cost of living**: living in El Salvador is rather affordable and if you meet the minimum income threshold you can have a good lifestyle.
- **Internet**: El Salvador tends to offer good internet speed. Although this will heavily depend on your location.
- **Climate**: given its location it offers warm weather year round.
- **Community**: growing community of remote workers in San Salvador, Santa Ana and La Libertad.
