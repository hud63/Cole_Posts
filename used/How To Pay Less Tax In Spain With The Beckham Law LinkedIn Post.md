Most expats in Spain pay up to 45% income tax. But there's a legal loophole that caps your rate at 24%, and you only pay tax on Spanish income, not worldwide.

It's called the Beckham Law, and it's been saving high earners millions since 2004. The catch? You need to know exactly how to qualify and when to apply.

Missing the 6-month deadline means paying double the tax for years. But nail the strategy, and you keep 21% more of every euro earned.

Here's your step-by-step guide to legally slashing your Spanish tax burden:

*Step 1: Verify Your 10-Year Clean Record*

You cannot have been a Spanish tax resident for the 10 calendar years before your employment placement.

• Check your tax filing history in Spain from the past decade
• Gather documentation proving non-resident status during this period  
• Verify no Spanish social security contributions or resident tax returns
• Confirm you haven't owned Spanish property triggering resident status

This qualification is absolute, even one year of residency disqualifies you completely.

*Step 2: Secure the Right Employment Structure*

The placement must result from an employment contract or company administrator role with specific ownership limits.

Your employer must provide a formal employment contract or letter of assignment that explicitly states your Spanish work placement. If becoming a company administrator, you cannot own more than 25% of the entity. Professional athletes have additional flexibility under special provisions, but the core employment requirement remains non-negotiable for most applicants.

*Step 3: File Form 149 Within Six Months*

This is where most people lose the opportunity, timing is everything.

• Submit application within 6 months of Spanish social security enrollment
• Include passport, employment contract, and supporting documentation
• File through Spanish tax authorities (Agencia Tributaria)
• Confirm acceptance before first tax year begins

Missing this deadline means you're locked into resident tax rates with no second chances.

*Step 4: Understand Your Tax Advantages and Limits*

The 24% flat rate applies only to Spanish-sourced income, with wealth and capital gains benefits limited to Spanish assets.

You'll pay 24% on Spanish employment income (45% over €600,000 annually) while foreign income remains untaxed in Spain. Spanish property sales trigger capital gains tax, but your London property sale doesn't. Wealth tax applies only to Spanish assets. However, you cannot access double taxation treaties, potentially creating tax obligations in other jurisdictions.

Maximum benefit period is six tax years before returning to standard resident rates.

The Beckham Law isn't right for everyone, low earners might pay more than standard rates. But for high-income professionals, it's Spain's best-kept tax secret.
