**most interesting one is Poland,** where you can pay an annual flat fee of PLN 200,000 (EUR 47,000), and then donate PLN 100,000 (EUR 23,500) annually to Polish non-profit and charitable organizations or to support the Polish economy. Then you don't have to pay ANY TAXES on foreign income (so it's pure Paraguay style). You can use this regimen for up to 10 years.

THE LUMP-SUM TAX FOR HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS
KEY INDICATORS
● Maximum duration: 10 years
● Years of non-tax-residence required to qualify: 5 of the last 6 years
● Extendable to family members? Yes
Executive Summary
Poland has introduced a special lump-sum taxation regime to attract
high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) by offering simplified and favorable tax
treatment for foreign income. Under this regime, foreign taxpayers who
change their tax residency to Poland can opt for an annual lump-sum tax of
PLN 200,000 (approximately €48,000) on their entire foreign income,
excluding controlled foreign entity (CFC) income, regardless of the amount
of foreign income received in that year. Income earned within Poland is taxed
under the standard rules.
To qualify, taxpayers must meet certain eligibility requirements, including
non-residency in Poland for at least five of the last six years and making an
annual investment of at least PLN 100,000 (approximately €24,000) in areas
contributing to Poland’s economic growth, cultural heritage, education, or
physical culture. The regime offers reduced disclosure obligations and may be
extended to close relatives at a discounted annual rate of PLN 100,000
(approximately €24,000).
Any excess expenditure beyond PLN 100,000 can be carried forward and
included in subsequent tax years. The lump-sum taxation regime is available
for a maximum of 10 years, making it a competitive option for HNWIs
seeking tax stability and reduced compliance obligations.

What are the eligibility requirements?
To qualify for Poland’s lump-sum taxation regime, an individual must meet
the following criteria:
1. Residency Condition:
The individual must not have been a Polish tax resident for at least five
out of the last six years prior to applying for the regime.
2. Investment Requirement:
The taxpayer must make an annual investment of at least PLN 100,000
(approximately €24,000) in areas that promote Polish economic
growth, development of science and education, protection of cultural
heritage, or promotion of physical culture. The taxpayer is obliged to
submit the written statement together with the documents confirming
that the expenses have been incurred.
3. Family Inclusion:
Close relatives of the taxpayer can also benefit from the regime at a
reduced lump-sum tax rate of PLN 100,000 annually (approximately
€20,000).
Taxpayers must be prepared to provide information on the source and
amount of foreign income upon request by the tax authorities, although the
regime generally imposes minimal disclosure obligations.
What are the principal tax benefits?
The lump-sum taxation regime offers several benefits to HNWIs relocating
to Poland:
● Fixed Tax Liability on Foreign Income:
Foreign income is subject to a flat annual tax of PLN 200,000
(approximately €48,000), regardless of the actual amount earned.
● Reduced Disclosure Obligations:
Taxpayers are not required to report the source or amount of their
foreign income unless specifically requested by Polish tax authorities.

● Family Benefits:
Close relatives may opt into the regime at a reduced rate of PLN
100,000 annually, providing an appealing option for families
relocating together.
● Standard Taxation of Domestic Income:
Income earned from Polish sources is taxed under normal Polish tax
rules, ensuring that the lump-sum regime does not interfere with
local tax obligations.
Which categories of income qualify for reduced taxation?
The lump-sum regime applies exclusively to foreign-source income, with
the exception of controlled foreign entity (CFC) income, which remains
subject to regular Polish tax rules. Income from Polish sources, such as
employment or business activities conducted within Poland, is excluded
from the regime and taxed under standard rates.
By restricting its application to foreign income, the regime incentivizes
high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) to relocate to Poland while
maintaining their international income streams.
