WHEN Ross Jenkins left school after his GCSEs he was told by his parents that he’d never find a job.

But now the 33-year-old runs a hugely successful business earning £185,000 a year, he chooses the hours he works and lives in a city with all-year-round sunshine.

Ross, who is from Kenilworth, outside Coventry, said: “When I was in school I had ADHD very badly and struggled massively because I just couldn’t concentrate on anything,” he says.

“I got into so much trouble in class and then left school with nothing – I think I got a B in tech and sports at GCSE and that was it.

“So, I didn’t go to university, not that I ever wanted to – but I tried college because my parents went to Uni, but it didn’t work for me.

“And, after doing an apprenticeship, I knew that I wanted to work for myself eventually, but it would take some time to get there.”

He started working in marketing in Coventry and he decided to get more experience to help him set up his own business.

After going solo, the now 33-year-old spent several years working as a freelance marketeer - but eventually set up his own company - DigitalME - www.digitalme.cc.

“I thought I could either work for the rest of my life for 30 grand a year or I could take a leap,” he says.

“At the time I didn’t have a girlfriend or a child, I had no responsibilities, so I flew to Barcelona and grinded the hell out of it. I was a hermit.

“I had less than £3,000 in the bank, but knew what I wanted to achieve and worked so hard.

“I started small, but things just grew and my client list and profile got bigger.

“Now my company is seven years old and we have over 2,000 clients – we are good at keeping them happy, have built great relationships and I really enjoy working with them.”

Jenkins who is engaged to his girlfriend, Estefania Pacheco soon-to-be Jenkins, 30, and has a three year old son, is now living in Dubai in the UAE.

He made the move to the Middle East after a client asked him to do some work out there - and now he has no plans to move back.

“I like visiting home but I would never live in the UK again because life in the Middle East is great,” he says.

“Ok, the heat right now is awful as it’s summertime, so it's absolutely scorching and you have to stay inside until about 7 or 8pm. But the food here is outstanding – every type of cuisine you could imagine.

“Right now, I’m still in that honeymoon phase of just enjoying everything.

"I make around £25,000 per month and because I live in the Middle East, it’s tax free. So I’m enjoying my work, my family, my lifestyle and the places I get to travel to - this is the motivation for me.

“When I was in the UK, I struggled to feel motivated. I was working hard, but didn’t have anything like the life I have here in the UAE.

"It’s fantastic – a really great place, with great opportunities. I see it like a mini USA now and it’s still growing and developing - so for me to be able to live and run my business here, is fantastic. I absolutely love it.”

But his lifestyle didn’t just come about by chance and the entrepreneur says that it "really annoys" him when people say that he is "lucky" to have his business as it is all down to sheer hard work.

“I worked my ass off,” he says. “When I first started this agency, I would work 18 to 20 hours a day for five to seven days a week.

"And even now, I work harder than my friends, and I’ve got some really successful friends.. But the reason I can work harder is because I really enjoy what I do and I’m excited to work every day.

“In the beginning a lot of people doubted me and when I said I was going to open my own business, they asked why I would do something like that, they said I should just get a normal job – I still remember people asking ‘when are you going to get a real job’.”

Presumably no-one is asking him that now as the father-of-one says that he has ‘already surpassed’ everything he thought he would achieve in life.

So he wants to encourage others who don’t want to study to still follow their dreams.

“There was a point when I didn’t even think I would pass my driving test as my hopes were so low,” he admits.

“My advice to someone else who doesn’t feel like they fit into the mould for going to third level would be to find something they enjoy doing – writing, speaking, art, coding – whatever.

“When I failed my GCSEs, I was shattered because I remember my parents saying that I would never get a good job, but I found what I wanted to do.”

But now he has a message for anyone who feels they don’t fit into the university mould.

He added: “Find something you love and that you’re going to enjoy – spend some time doing it on your own and then just pitch it to companies.

“Tell them that you’re trying to reach your goals and ask if you can come in and work with them for a few days a week, without pay, just to learn. Then build up the motivation to speak to other companies.

“My team and I still do that every day, emailing companies and asking if they want to work with us.

"It’s all about building relationships and getting where you want to be. In my opinion, it’s a lot harder than going to university, but it is so worth it.”
