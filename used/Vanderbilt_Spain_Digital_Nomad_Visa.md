🇪🇸 Spain's Digital Nomad Visa: Americans Living the Dream in Valencia

Spain's Digital Nomad Visa is delivering on its promise
and Americans on the ground after 2 months say "we love it."

The tax benefits are real.
Digital Nomads pay just 24% on income up to €600,000, compared to 30% or higher back home. The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion covers $130,000 for 2025

Spain is extremely LGBTQ+ friendly.
It's "one of the most socially open and tolerant countries in the world" with the most advanced protections, even by liberal European standards.

Valencia and Malaga offer the perfect lifestyle.
Chill, friendly, open cities with a relaxed pace of life that Chicago tech workers are embracing. The visa is renewable for 5 years and converts to permanent residency.

Professional help makes it straightforward.
Consultancies like bureaucracy.es handle the entire visa process, and Americans report it's "worth it" to get expert guidance through the paperwork.
