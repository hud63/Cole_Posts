Starting Sierra was an early bet that AI agents would transform the enterprise software industry. At the time, we had to explain what the word ‚Äúagent‚Äù meant to every potential customer, and we had no idea we‚Äôd build something that would resonate with businesses this quickly, or deeply.

Today, we‚Äôre announcing that we‚Äôve raised $350M additional capital at a valuation of $10B, led by Greenoaks, which is doubling down on Sierra.

We‚Äôre deeply grateful to our earliest design partners and customers, and to the incredible group of builders and entrepreneurs who‚Äôve joined us to help build Sierra into what it is today.

### Our progress so far

Eighteen months in, Sierra has hundreds of customers, including some of the most recognizable brands in Financial Services, Healthcare, Telecommunications, Retail, and Consumer Services.

The companies succeeding with Sierra include the largest, most sophisticated, and heavily regulated in the world. Over 20% of our customers have revenue over $10 billion, and over half have revenue over $1 billion.

In Retail, Sierra agents reach over 90% of Americans. In Healthcare, Sierra agents reach over 50% of US families. In Financial Services, Sierra agents are helping the fastest growing fintechs and many of the largest banks in the US and Europe to create delightful, more human customer experiences with AI.

Sierra agents are helping hundreds of millions of people refinance homes, get roadside assistance, dispute charges, understand insurance deductibles, deliver furniture, fix printers, and get their internet working. Want to order a salad for lunch or fix your home alarm system? There‚Äôs an agent for that, and it‚Äôs running on Sierra.

### Solving our customers‚Äô hardest problems

We will use our new funding ‚Äì along with our strong revenue growth and balance sheet ‚Äì to increase our investments in our platform, US growth, and international expansion.

Sierra‚Äôs Agent OS is designed to empower both customer experience teams and developers to build exceptionally effective AI agents. We‚Äôre doubling down on our investments to apply the latest advancements in AI to all parts of the agent development life cycle:

- Making it even easier to get up and running with or without technical expertise
- Enabling AI insights to automatically find and suggest agent improvements to drive CSAT, NPS, and revenue
- Expanding beyond customer service to enable companies to improve the lifetime value of their customers by driving sales and engagement with their AI agent

In addition to investing in our platform, we‚Äôre excited to expand beyond our offices in San Francisco, New York, London, and Atlanta to build a larger presence in Europe and Asia. We want to bring Sierra to every company in the world, and it starts with having a presence in all parts of it.

### The path ahead

We're in this for the long term ‚Äì to create the platform on which the best customer experiences in the world are built. Making that dream a reality is all about execution: we need to deliver for every customer, every time, without exception. The opportunity ahead is enormous, for our customers, their customers, and Sierra.

ùúè¬≤-bench: benchmarking agents in collaborative real-world scenarios

ùúè¬≤-bench challenges AI agents not just to reason and act, but to coordinate, guide, and assist a user in achieving a shared objective. This leap from solo operation to co-ownership of a task pushes agents into a much more demanding space. And, critically, it reflects the kinds of tasks AI agents are increasingly being asked to perform in the real world.
