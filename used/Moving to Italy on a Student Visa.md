Many people dream of relocating to Italy, but what exactly is the process to reside long-term in the country? In fact, a long-stay visa is required for non-EU citizens to stay longer than 90 days, and one such option would be the student visa. This article will explain everything you need to know about applying for and living in Italy with a student visa.

Overview

First, it’s important to understand when a visa is required to enter Italy and how to acquire one. Italian citizens (including those who acquired citizenship jure sanguinis) and EU citizens do not need a visa to reside in Italy. On the other hand non-EU citizens are allowed to stay in the Schengen Area only for 90 days. The Schengen Area, which includes Italy, consists of 29 European countries that have a shared visa policy and removed border controls, enabling freedom of movement throughout the member countries. To stay for a longer period, non EU citizens would need a long-stay visa, also called a Type D-visa. These can include the Elective Residence Visa, Investor Visa, Digital Nomad Visa, and also the Student Visa.

The visa and residence process in Italy is comprised of two steps, securing a visa to enter the country and then converting it into the corresponding residence permit to stay in the country for the duration set by the visa. Since the visa is a type of entry document, it needs to be applied for before arriving to Italy at your local Italian consulate abroad. Then, upon entering the country, generally within 8 days, it is required to visit the questura, or police headquarters, to convert the visa into the residence permit.

It’s also worth noting that if you have Italian ancestry to the second degree (parent or grandparent who was born in Italy), you are able to apply for Italian citizenship after 2 years of residence in Italy. This is an alternate path to citizenship for those who may not qualify for Italian citizenship jure sanguinis according to the new guidelines in the Tajani Law. In order to legally establish a period of 2-year residence, a long-stay visa will be necessary, such as a student visa.

Requirements for Student Visa

The Italian consulates list requirements for the general study visa on their website, but also may have criteria for more specific scenarios, for instance, if you are enrolled in a full Italian University program, attending a single university course, post-graduate studies, participating in an exchange program, traineeship and apprenticeship, or vocational training.

Documents that are generally required for a student visa, but can vary slightly depending on your local Italian consulate, include:

Completed long-term visa application form
Passport (valid for at least 3 months past the last day of intended stay abroad)
Passport-size photo
Proof of residence under consular jurisdiction (i.e. driver’s license, state ID, recent tax return)
Proof of accommodation in Italy covering your entire stay in Italy (lease, university dorm, hotel, etc.).  
	If you are staying with an individual instead of your university, that individual must fill out the “Declaration of Hospitality” with a photocopy of his/her passport (if your host is a foreign citizen living in Italy, also required is a copy of his/her “permesso di soggiorno”).
Health insurance covering the duration of the stay in Italy
Application fee of €50, to be paid in dollars at the current exchange rate
Proof of financial means, at least $40 per day for the entire duration of the program.*  
	This can be proven through:*  
	*– Bank letter showing the details of your personal bank account or bank letter showing the details of a joint bank account in your name and your family’s (on the bank’s letterhead, signed by a bank official and with a recent date).  
	– Parents’ bank statement indicating the account balance, their notarized Affidavit of Financial Support stating their financial commitment for expenses incurred in Italy, plus a letter from your bank (on the bank’s letterhead, signed by a bank official and with a recent date).  
	– The account balance must equal or exceed the minimums established by the Ministry of the Interior’s Directive of March 1, 2000 (
A self-addressed, pre-paid US Postal Service Priority or Express Mail envelope for the passport to be mailed back to you
Return flight tickets  
	Many consulates require the submission of your flight itinerary, including return flight tickets showing departure from the Schengen area.
Documentation on the course or program that you will be attending:*This can be proven through:  
	\-– Enrollment Letter from the Educational Institution in Italy addressed to the Visa Office of the Italian Consulate confirming the enrollment of the student, program dates, duration, weekly hours of attendance (minimum 20 hours a week). It’s important that the letter is written in Italian and signed by the program administrator.  
	\-– Some consulates may require a transcript or certificate relating to previous studies in your home country, particularly if enrolling in an Italian language course*

Additional documents may be required if you are applying for a more specialized study visa, such as enrollment in a full Italian university program. It’s always advised to check your local Italian consulate’s website for a full list of requirements. For example, some courses may require pre-enrollment registration through the Universitaly portal and a “Dichiarazione di Valore” (Declaration of Value) issued by the School Office of the Italian Consulate that has jurisdiction over the University that issued the certificate.

Applying for a Student Visa

Once you have gathered all the required documentation for the student visa as indicated by your local Italian consulate, you will be required to make an appointment to submit the application. The appointment must be attended in person and should be scheduled no later than 15 days prior to the date of departure and no earlier than 6 months prior. Appointments can be made through the consulate’s online Prenot@mi portal. Processing time for the visa is generally about 15 days from the day of the appointment.

Within 8 days of arriving in Italy, it is necessary to go first to the post office to request the residence permit “kit” which includes the forms to apply for the corresponding permit. For example, a study visa would be a permesso di soggiorno per motivi di studio. You will submit your completed application and supporting documents to the post office, including a copy of your passport and study visa, course enrollment letter, photocopy of health insurance, and copies of the documents proving financial means and accommodation in Italy. It will also be necessary to purchase a revenue stamp (marca da bollo) and submit the application payment. You will then be scheduled for an appointment at the questura, to complete the permit application and process fingerprints, and this appointment will be noted on your receipt from the post office. In the meantime, this receipt confirms your legal residence in lieu of the actual permit, so be sure to have it with you at all times. After the appointment at the questura, the permit will be processed, and you will be informed when the physical card is ready to be retrieved. The study permit is usually valid for a period dictated by the course dates.

Living in Italy as a Student

While living in Italy on a student visa, it’s also possible to work. According to the parameters of the visa, you are only allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours per week (no more than 1,040 hours per year).

Since the student visa is only valid for the time of your course, you may wonder how to extend your residence in Italy. In many cases, the student visa is not renewable unless it was initially issued for a multi-year study course. If the course you are attending is completed and you want to enroll in a different program, you will be required to apply for a new visa. There is the possibility of converting a student residence permit into a work residence permit if certain conditions are met, such as having a valid contract for subordinate work. There is also the possibility of applying for a “residence permit for job search”, which involves making a declaration to be immediately available for work at the Employment Center (Centro per l’impiego) in the city where you are living.
