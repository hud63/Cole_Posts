**The cheapest Spanish destinations for expats revealed - with monthly rent from just £260**

Spain's cheapest destinations for expats have been revealed - and it's good news for those who are after sun, sand and significantly lower monthly expenses.

As living costs in major Spanish cities continue to rise, new data reveals that smaller towns and inland regions are becoming increasingly attractive to expats and remote workers seeking a more affordable lifestyle.

According Euro Weekly News, places such as Jaén, Cádiz, Castilla-La Mancha, Galicia and Extremadura now rank among the cheapest places in the country for foreign residents.

In these areas, rent is notably lower than in tourist-heavy locations such as Madrid, Barcelona and Alicante, with some locations offering housing for as little as €4 to €6 per square metre.

A 70-square metre apartment in many inland towns can cost between €300 (£260) and €400 (£350) per month - less than half the price of a similar property in expensive coastal or metropolitan areas across Spain.

In central areas of smaller cities, such as Ávila, Ourense, and Cáceres, one-bedroom apartments can be snapped up for under €600 (£520) a month.

Towns like Trujillo, Zamora, and Ciudad are emerging as preferred destinations for expats looking to balance affordability with access to essential services.

Not only do these areas offer lower rents, they also provide quieter environments, more space, lush surrounding landscapes, a sunny climate throughout the year, and traditional Mediterranean lifestyles.

Their appeal also lies in lower monthly expenses, less congestion and a growing digital nomad structure that allows remote workers to live comfortably outside major cities.

Expats in these areas frequently report living well on under €1,200 (£1,045) a month, covering rent, food, utilities, and transport.

While cheaper regions offer an affordable lifestyle, there are a number of trade-offs.

Smaller towns and rural regions may have limited public transportation, and services such as healthcare, high-speed internet and international schools may not be as accessible or as available as in larger urban cities.

But for expats and digital nomads who are willing to adapt, Spain's inland, hidden-gem towns and cities offer a mix of affordability, charm and a quality of life that is becoming increasingly difficult to find in key hubs across Europe.

Meanwhile, a British expat who has lived in Spain for 38 years revealed a common 'mistake' people make before relocating - while sharing his top tips for those hoping to follow in his footsteps.

Daniel Efford, who is based in La Cala de Mijas on the Costa del Sol, regularly shares his love for the region's sunny weather, stunning mountainous landscapes and local cuisine on social media.

However, in a recent video posted to his TikTok page, @danielefford23, the operations manager gave his insights on what to truly expect when relocating to Spain.

Though he described general day-to-day life in Spain as 'brilliant,' he admitted the move is 'not easy.'

He said: 'I think one of the biggest stumbling blocks that people have, is that when they come to Spain, they come as holidaymakers.

'They don't really take into consideration what happens behind the scenes. They come for a week, see the way of life and go "I could do that!" It's just a mistake.'

Issuing some 'words of advice,' Efford urged potential expats mingle with and speak to locals before relocating in order to get a true feel of Spanish tradition.
