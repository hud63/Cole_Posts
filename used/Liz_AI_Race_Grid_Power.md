It's easy to panic about losing the AI race.

Silicon Valley whispers: "China has unlimited power. We're stuck with blackouts. Game over."

But that narrative falls apart with basic math:

👉 China's coal plants run at 46.4% capacity (record low)
👉 They added 105 GW of solar in 4 months (desperation mode)
👉 IEA projects global data centers need 945 TWh by 2030
👉 Everyone's grid is getting hammered, not just ours

This isn't "China won because infinite electricity."

This is "AI doubled energy consumption in 18 months and nobody's infrastructure was ready."

And yes …

The U.S. has real grid challenges.

But look deeper.

American AI companies aren't shutting down. They're signing direct utility deals. Restarting nuclear plants. Building on-site generation.

You know what they're not doing?

Declaring defeat because a DOE report (conveniently released to justify infrastructure spending) predicted doom.

Often, you don't have a competition problem.

You have a narrative problem.

And you're believing the hype.
