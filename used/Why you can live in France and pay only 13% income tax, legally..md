**Angle:** (What) France offers a special tax status called the 'micro-entreprise' regime designed for small businesses and freelancers.

  

(Why) Standard French income taxes can reach 45%, with social contributions adding another 35-45%. This regime is the key to making the dream of living in France a financial reality.

- Calculate income tax using the standard brackets but on your much lower fictional profit.
- Pay a simplified, flat social contribution rate of 21.20% on your total turnover.

  

  

**Takeaway:** Don't let France's reputation for high taxes deter you. The micro-entreprise regime is a straightforward path for service-based freelancers to significantly reduce their tax bill and enjoy the French lifestyle.
