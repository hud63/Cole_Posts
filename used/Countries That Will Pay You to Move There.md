Countries That Will Pay You to Move There: FAQs
Relocate and Get Paid

Italy has the highest share of people over 65 years old of all EU member states, and if this trend continues, the implications could be serious.

Demographic decline is an increasingly pressing issue for a number of nations.

Some countries, faced with ageing populations and abandoned towns, are offering incentives in an effort to attract new residents.

To attract an influx of people, they provide incentives to encourage relocation, such as grants for starting businesses, covering living expenses or offering funding for home renovations.

Before making a move to a new country, you need to understand exactly what you’re getting yourself into.

The following are our top picks – countries that will pay you to move there, looking at the specific requirements of these programs and exploring your residency options.

Ireland

If living on one of around thirty picturesque islands off the coast of Ireland sounds like the dream life, the Irish Government will pay you to do so.

These stunning and rugged islands include Bere Island, Inishbofin, Clare Island and Arranmore.

In 2023, Ireland launched its ‘ Our Living Islands ‘ program to repopulate and revitalise remote islands, offering participants up to €84,000 to restore abandoned properties.

Despite the hype surrounding this program, fewer than 30 applications for renovation grants on the islands have been received.

These islands are cut off from the mainland, requiring boat or plane travel. Additionally, the program doesn’t assist with immigration, so participants must follow the standard process for Irish residency.

The program offers a Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant for refurbishing homes on the islands. To qualify, you must purchase a property built before 2007 that has been vacant for at least two years.

The property must serve as your primary residence. Foreign nationals can apply, but they are responsible for their immigration procedures. The program aims to boost population, diversify economies and support sustainable futures.

Residence in Ireland

Ireland

Are you a successful entrepreneur or business owner? The Ireland Start-up Entrepreneur Program offers you the chance to secure long-term residence in Ireland.

To qualify, your business must be a high-potential start-up introducing an innovative product or service and have €50,000 in available funds. This could be new startups with viable business ideas or a business relocating to Ireland. Funding sources can include personal funds, loans, angel investors, venture capital or grants from the Irish State Agency.

Applicants’ businesses must be classified as high-potential start-ups, introducing something new or innovative, and should not involve retail, catering or personal services.

It must aim to create ten jobs in Ireland within three to four years and have the potential for €1 million in sales during the same period. The business plan should show high growth potential, and must be headquartered in Ireland, with you as the main founder.

If your application is successful, you will receive a two-year residence permit. You can renew it for an additional three years if the business remains viable. After five years, a permanent residence permit can be applied for if the business is still thriving.

One thing to note is that Ireland’s Start-up Entrepreneur Program is more accessible than the UK’s version. As an EU member, Ireland offers citizens free movement across the EU and is the only native English-speaking country in Europe.

Irish residents and their families gain EU residency and access to top-tier education and free healthcare. Ireland also offers a potentially favourable tax environment, with double taxation treaties and a low corporate tax rate of 12.5%.

Switzerland

Albinen is a charming mountain village in Valais, Switzerland, located in the Rhône Valley and near the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park, Leukerbad and the Matterhorn.

Life in the village is far from boring, with historic farmhouses, a surrounding nature park filled with forests, and winegrowing villages to explore.

Nestled on a steep slope, Albinen is facing a population decline and has launched an incentive program offering CHF25,000 (about US$30,500) per adult under 45 and CHF10,000 (around US$12,200) per child.

To qualify, applicants must obtain a permanent residency permit and commit to purchasing a property to live in for at least 10 years.

Residence in Switzerland

Switzerland

For non-EU/EAA nationals looking to make Switzerland their permanent home, there are two options for residency:

Swiss company formation
Swiss lump-sum taxation.

The first option requires establishing a business in Switzerland with a minimum capital of CHF20,000 (about US$24,500) for a Limited Liability Company or CHF100,000 (about US$122,000) for a Joint Stock Company.

The business must generate enough income to cover your living expenses, and you must show financial independence.

The lump sum taxation scheme allows non-residents to pay a fixed amount in taxes ranging from CHF250,000 (around US$306,000) to CHF1 million.

For EU citizens, obtaining a Swiss residency permit is simpler. The B Permit is a short-term, renewable permit for living and working in Switzerland, while the C Permit grants permanent residency after ten years on a B Permit.

Switzerland offers one of the safest and most secure environments on earth, with the political stability and neutrality that many desire.

Switzerland also offers social security and provides excellent health care, disability and pension benefits to residents.

Italy

Italy’s famed €1 home initiative provides grants to restore abandoned properties in rural areas. Tuscany offers €10,000 to €30,000 to move to one of 76 mountain towns and buy a home, while Sardinia provides up to €15,000 for buying and renovating properties in small towns.

US citizens need a long-term residence permit to qualify. Italy has also introduced a digital nomad visa, enabling visitors to access towns like Ollolai.

These housing packages usually require costly and difficult renovations, but grants are available. As these programs continue to emerge, they aim to revitalise smaller towns while encouraging expats to contribute positively to their new communities.

Residence in Italy

Italy

The path to permanent residency in Italy depends on which type of visa and temporary residency you first secure.

The Investor Visa program allows non-EU citizens to secure a two-year residency permit in Italy, renewable for three years, through specific investments:

€2 million in Italian government bonds (held for at least two years)
€250,000 in an existing local startup
€500,000 in a local company for a minimum of two years
€1 million in philanthropic donations to approved institutions
Equity financing for an Italian limited company focused on innovative startup ideas.

The Elective Residency Visa (ERV) allows for an initial one-year stay in Italy and is intended for those seeking permanent residency. It does not permit work or active income, making it suitable for retirees. Italian citizenship can be pursued once you maintain residency for ten years.

Spain

Spain is also striving to boost its smaller towns. Digital nomads, particularly in the tech sector, have a unique opportunity to relocate to the Extremadura region of Spain, located just north of Seville.

If you appreciate the distinct charm of Spain but wish to avoid the hustle and bustle of larger cities like Madrid or Barcelona, this is an exciting prospect.

Eligible individuals can receive grants of €10,000 for those under 30 and €8,000 for others who live in towns with fewer than 5,000 residents. An additional grant of €5,000 for those under-30s and €4,000 for others is available.

Spain’s Digital Nomad Visa

Spain

Spain’s Digital Nomad Visa is emerging as one of Europe’s most competitive options.

This visa allows remote work but also offers tax benefits and a potential route to long-term EU residency. It enables remote workers to live in Spain while employed by foreign companies.

The Spanish Digital Nomad Visa offers several compelling benefits:

Long-term residency and citizenship
Special tax credits
Family Inclusion
Freedom to live, work and travel within the Schengen Area.

To be eligible for Spain’s Digital Nomad Visa, you must be a national of a non-EEA country or Switzerland. EU/EEA or Swiss passport holders do not need this visa.

Key requirements include:

Proof of remote work and earnings
Evidence of a relevant university degree or at least three years of experience in your field
You need to demonstrate a monthly income of at least €2,762 and more for dependents.
A health insurance policy covering all of Spain for your entire stay
A clean criminal record certificate.

The Digital Nomad Visa serves as a gateway for non-EU citizens to access the European Union. Many view it as a stepping stone to staying in the EU longer or even pursuing Spanish citizenship for a strong EU passport.

Countries That Will Pay You to Move There: FAQs

Which places pay you to live there?

Several countries and local governments facing issues with ageing populations or abandoned towns are offering incentives, such as accelerator programs, build-to-grant schemes, skilled workers programs, or new business grants, to encourage the relocation and rejuvenation of local communities. These include Ireland’s remote islands, small towns in Italy, Santiago, Chile and underpopulated areas of Japan, as well as some other countries.

Can foreign nationals move to one of Ireland’s offshore islands?

The Our Living Islands program does not include any proposals or schemes to facilitate immigration procedures or resettlement to Ireland’s offshore islands, and therefore, the residency requirements are the same as the rest of Ireland.

How does the purchase of 1 Euro houses work?

In certain Italian municipalities, property owners allow the sale of houses for a symbolic price of €1. Buyers must commit to developing a restructuring and revaluation property project.

Can you get paid to move to Japan?

Yes, the Japanese government is offering financial incentives to encourage relocation to remote areas with declining populations. Households can expect an initial payment of 1 million yen (about US$6800), plus an extra 1 million yen for each child under the age of 18.

Is Albinen a good place to live in Switzerland?

Life in Albinen, Switzerland, is suited to those looking for strong social ties, cultural events and beautiful surroundings. Residents enjoy a close-knit community that fosters friendships and local support. This attractive destination offers outdoor activities like hiking and skiing. However, the remote location means limited job prospects and limited facilities and services.

Relocate and Get Paid

Clickbait headlines enticing you to Tuscany with a €1 home can be misleading, as these programs are far more involved and complicated than they first seem.

Most of these programs require that you live there for at least part of the year, and some mean you need to relocate there full-time.

If you don’t mind a cooler climate and want to relocate to Europe, one of Ireland’s remote islands could be your next home.

If you have always dreamed of reconnecting with your Italian roots and don’t mind living in a remote area, their program might be worth considering.

Paid-to-move programs are very niche, and thankfully, there are far more accessible options for relocating offshore through a second residence and citizenship program.

If you’re exploring new residency or citizenship options, the time to act is now.
