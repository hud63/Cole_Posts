# Erica Framework Test: Property Taxes Are Theft

## Content Option #1: Absurdist Conspiracy Theory

OMG I figured out why DeSantis wants to abolish property taxes in Florida. This is not about fiscal policy. I've cracked the code.

Property = 8 letters.
Taxes = 5 letters.
8 + 5 = 13.

13 is obviously the unlucky number that controls the housing market through invisible forces.

But wait, it gets deeper.

Florida has 6 letters. DeSantis has 8 letters. 6 + 8 = 14.

14 - 13 = 1.

ONE. As in "one nation under God" which appears on money, which you use to pay property taxes, which DeSantis wants to eliminate.

Coincidence? I THINK NOT.

Look at "property tax." If you rearrange the letters and squint really hard while humming the national anthem, it spells "YTREPORP XAT" which is clearly ancient Floridian for "gator wisdom prevails."

And what do gators do? They live in swamps. What's another word for swamp? THE SWAMP.

DeSantis isn't abolishing property taxes. He's speaking in gator code to drain the literal swamp by making homes tax-free so people move there and the gators have to relocate to... WASHINGTON D.C.

This is why I'm buying a calculator and moving to a state that doesn't have letters that add up to conspiracy numbers.

Wake up, homeowners. The gators are coming for your mortgage statements.

The dumbest financial advice ever given to Americans?

"Your home is your biggest investment."

DeSantis just proved this is complete BS by proposing to abolish property taxes in Florida, and the reaction reveals how delusional we've become about "homeownership."

Here's the brutal truth about what we call "owning" a home:

1. You never actually own it. Miss your annual government rent payment (property tax) and watch how fast "your" house becomes theirs. That's not ownership, that's a subscription service with the worst customer support on earth.

2. Your "investment" actively punishes success. Home values go up? Great! Now you owe the government more money for the crime of living in a place that became more desirable. It's like being taxed for having good taste.

3. You're funding systems you don't use. Paying $30K annually in property taxes to fund schools while spending $70K per kid on private education? That's not civic duty, that's financial masochism.

The system is designed to keep you trapped in a cycle of perpetual payments disguised as "responsibility."

DeSantis gets it: true ownership means nobody can take it from you for non-payment of annual tribute.

If you're tired of renting your own house from the government, it's time to demand real ownership.

Support property tax abolition. Because subscription homeownership isn't homeownership at all.

## Content Option #3: Declarative Expertise

Property taxes are theft, full stop. And anyone defending them has Stockholm syndrome with government overreach.

I've been tracking tax policy across 12 states for the past 8 years, and I can tell you with absolute certainty: there is no moral justification for forcing people to pay annual rent on property they supposedly "own."

DeSantis proposing to abolish property taxes in Florida isn't radical—it's overdue common sense.

Here's what I know from working with hundreds of property owners:

TRUE OWNERSHIP = Zero ongoing government claims on your asset.

FAKE OWNERSHIP = Annual tribute payments or lose everything.

You want proof this system is broken? I have clients paying $40K annually in property taxes while their kids attend private school because the public schools those taxes fund are failing.

That's not taxation for services rendered. That's extortion with extra steps.

The beautiful part about DeSantis's proposal? It forces everyone to confront an uncomfortable truth: we've normalized government theft and called it "civic responsibility."

Florida about to show the rest of America what actual property ownership looks like.

And every other state is going to have to explain why they're still running a legalized protection racket.

Property taxes = paying rent on what you supposedly own.

Time to call it what it is.

## Content Option #4: Vulnerable Self-Reflection

"Property taxes are just part of homeownership." Someone said this to me yesterday, and I had to sit with how much that bothered me. Not because it was wrong, but because I realized I'd internalized the exact same lie.

I've been paying property taxes for 15 years. Every year, I write that check and feel this quiet resentment. But I told myself:

- "This is just how it works"
- "Everyone pays property taxes"
- "It funds important services"
- "This is the price of homeownership"

Then DeSantis proposes abolishing property taxes in Florida, and suddenly I'm confronting an uncomfortable question: What if I've been gaslighting myself this entire time?

There's something deeply unsettling about realizing you never truly own something you thought you owned.

When I really think about it, what's the difference between property taxes and rent? Both are ongoing payments. Both result in losing your place if you don't pay. Both are determined by someone else's valuation of your space.

The only difference is the story we tell ourselves about one versus the other.

---

I keep coming back to this: Why did I accept that owning something means paying for the privilege of keeping it?

In what other area of life do we call this ownership?

If I buy a car and someone demands annual payments based on its value or they take it away, we'd call that theft. But somehow when it's property and the government does it, we call it civic responsibility?

---

Maybe the most uncomfortable part isn't the taxation itself. It's recognizing how quickly I learned to rationalize being forced to pay for something I thought I already bought.

How many other systems have I normalized simply because "that's how it works"?

---

DeSantis might be onto something bigger than tax policy. He might be forcing us to examine the difference between what we think we own and what we actually control.

And honestly? That's a conversation I'm not sure I was ready to have, but desperately needed to start.

What do you think—are we really homeowners, or just long-term renters with better marketing?
