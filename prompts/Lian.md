**Context**

Format #1: Personal Stories & Life Lessons

This format uses first-person narrative to share vulnerable experiences that led to universal business insights. The story creates emotional connection while teaching practical lessons.

Attributes that make this format compelling:

- Opens with a bold, intriguing statement about a personal mistake or realization
- Uses specific ages, timeframes, and dollar amounts to add credibility
- Shows a clear transformation arc from struggle to success
- Breaks down the journey with emoji markers and formatted sections
- Ends with a universal lesson that readers can apply to their own lives
- Includes a P.S. question that invites reflection and engagement

Here are ideal examples of Format #1: Personal Stories & Life Lessons posts.

Example #1:

Being cheap is expensive.

I learned that the hard way.

Poor people fear spending money,
because they compare price to income.

So they pay in different currencies:

• Time
• Effort
• Focus

 I grew up broke and made that mistake too.

That mindset led me to bad financial decisions:

🏭/ 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
- I can get it for free on YouTube.

Then I'd spend 200 hours watching free videos,
while I could just pay $99 to get all I needed.

🏮/ 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗯𝘂𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲
- I thought I'd figure it out myself.

Then I'd bang my head against the wall, instead
of just asking someone who's been there.

🏯/ 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗯𝘂𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗿𝗼 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀
- I can figure it out using free alternatives.

Then I'd waste dozens of extra hours,
using 10 different tools instead of one.

But everything changed when I stopped asking
what it costs, and started asking what it gets me.

Now I'm happy to pay to:

• Save time
• Move faster
• Stay focused

That small shift grew my income,
knowledge and skills 10 times faster.

Rich people aren't better at saving.

They're just good at buying outcomes.

P.S. Are you a saver or a spender? 👇

Example #2:

At 22, I learned the wrong lesson.

It took me 3 years to unlearn it.

💰 Everything was lining up perfectly:

• My day job was paying well $
• Side-hustle was thriving $$
• New deal just killed it $$$

I had a season of success.

Freedom to do whatever I wanted.

Enough money to coast for a decade.

🤦‍♂️ But it taught me the wrong lessons:

→ I could outsmart everyone
→ I had found an easy way
→ I was special

👉 I confused luck with skill.

Sure enough, I began:

• Rejecting hard work
• Looking for easy ways
• Forgetting where I started

But whatever I tried,
I couldn't repeat the success.

I was stuck and too proud to admit it.

🤷‍♂️ Until finally I burned out and quit.

There had to be something I was missing.

So, I spent 3 years soul-searching.

But everything I learned led me
back to the same challenge.

The easy season was over.

I had to face hard work to grow.

💁‍♂️ I finished at the same place I started, but:

• Lazier
• Poorer
• Outdated

The only positive difference was
the acceptance and humility.

I unlearned all of the bullshit.

My new mindset was set:

• I'm not a special snowflake
• I can't outsmart everyone
• There's no easy way

This completely changed my life
and paid off a thousand times over.

It took me 3 years to realize:

"The hard way is the easy way."

I already did what was easy.
So did everyone else.
It wasn't enough.

P.S. What's your take on Hard vs. Smart?👇

Format #2: LinkedIn Growth Tactics

This format provides specific, actionable strategies for succeeding on LinkedIn. It focuses on platform-specific tactics with numbered lists and clear dos/don'ts.

Attributes that make this format compelling:

Example #1:

Want your LinkedIn to grow painfully slow?

These 15 newbie mistakes will do the trick:

 1. Allowing comments only from your connections.
 2. Asking for email verification to connect with you.
 3. Using the Connect button as the primary one.
 4. Ignoring your profile photo, text, or banner.
 5. Skipping industry keywords in your profile.
 6. Sending templated DMs or cold pitches.
 7. Tagging people randomly in your posts.
 8. Being active for only 15 minutes a day.
 9. Posting in groups instead of your feed.
10. Copy-pasting AI content or comments.
11. Overloading your posts with hashtags.
12. Sending random connection requests.
13. Adding external links in every post.
14. Participating in engagement pods.
15. Mass-automating your activity.

I see people making these mistakes daily.
Months later, they have the same reach.

Want to make it harder? Ignore the basics.
Want to grow faster? Master them.

Example #2:

99% of LinkedIn DMs fail.

But it's not because your offer sucks.

After over a decade in online marketing,
I've seen every outreach play in the book.

These days, I get more DMs than most people send.

While I respect the hustle, most are dead on arrival.

👉 Here are the 10 most common DM mistakes:

🏭/ 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 / 𝘂𝗻𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘀
↳ Research their context, needs, and goals.
↳ Watch for signals of a problem or interest.

🏮/ 𝗣𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵-𝘀𝗹𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 / 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴
↳ Start with building a connection first.
↳ Asking for permission to pitch isn't it.

🏯/ 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀
↳ Mention specific things you researched.
↳ Always go in-depth to show expertise.

🏰/ 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁 / 𝗳𝗹𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘆
↳ Aim to be helpful, direct, and genuine.
↳ Respect their time with clarity, not charm.

🏱/ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄
↳ Don't be the first to ask about their problems.
↳ Show what you know, they'll ask you for advice.

🏲/ 𝗔𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗮 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼𝗼 𝘀𝗼𝗼𝗻
↳ Build interest and give value before asking.
↳ Let them request the next step, don't push it.

🏳/ 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁
↳ Use short lines and a clear structure.
↳ Make it scannable in under 5 seconds.

🏴/ 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿 𝗮𝗴𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄-𝘂𝗽𝘀
↳ Follow up gently with added context.
↳ Stop after 2 unanswered messages.

🏵/ 𝗔𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗮𝘃𝗼𝗿𝘀
↳ Lead with value. Give until they ask.
↳ Ask if they know someone instead.

🏰/ 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗼𝗳 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸
↳ Show your past work or share your IP
↳ Help them do the first step for free

🤦‍♂️ Most people treat LinkedIn DMs like cold emails.

Most cold email strategies rely on high volume.
Send 1,000s of emails daily, and someone will bite.

LinkedIn limits connection requests to 200 a week.
A cold email approach on LinkedIn will take you ages.

So, if you want to sell better on LinkedIn:

Stop pitching. Start connecting.

↳ Use hook templates to turn one idea into many.
↳ {X} {Lessons/Mistakes/Myths/Steps/Tools} To Do {Y}.

🏲/ 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗛𝗮𝘁𝘀
↳ Try on hats: Expert, Reporter, Witness, Thinker.
↳ How I  /  How To  /  How [Name]  /  What I think ...

🏳/ 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
↳ Break down big topics into lists or steps.
↳ Break down each step into 3 bullets.

🏴/ 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴

↳ Read comments, forums, replies, and questions.

🏵/ 𝗛𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗴𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀
↳ Brainstorm in a busy environment with a time limit.
↳ Go for a 10-minute walk with any note-taker.

🏰/ 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗸
↳ Write down random ideas from your head.
↳ Don't judge, just dump them in there.

🏷/ 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝗔𝗜
↳ Use any AI tool like ChatGPT, Grok, or Claude.
↳ Try different prompts to see what works best.

🏸/ 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲
↳ Rewrite and remix some of your past posts.
↳ Note: reposting the exact copy kills reach.

Stop waiting for inspiration.

Start using the system that sparks it.

Format #3: Business Strategy & Frameworks

This format presents conceptual business frameworks that help readers understand complex strategies. It uses structured thinking to break down business concepts into digestible models.

Attributes that make this format compelling:

- Opens with a thought-provoking question about business strategy
- Uses numbered emoji markers (1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣) or special characters for visual hierarchy
- Presents multiple perspectives or stakeholder viewpoints
- Uses arrows (→, ↳) and checkmarks (✅) vs X marks (❌) to show good/bad practices
- Provides concrete examples for abstract concepts
- Ends with a clear framework readers can apply immediately

Here are ideal examples of Format #3: Business Strategy & Frameworks posts.

Example #1:

Who should businesses put first?

[  ] Employees, otherwise they'll leave!
[  ] Customers, they pay your salary!
[  ] Investors, you owe them money!

But the right answer depends on who's asking.

Here's how it actually works:

👨‍💼 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗲𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗽𝘂𝘁 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁.
- Employees are the closest and most equipped
to serve customers. That should be their main goal.

✊ 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗽𝘂𝘁 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗲𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁.
- Leaders are the closest to employees, and
their job is to help employees serve customers.

💰 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗽𝘂𝘁 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁.
- Investors are the most distant from employees
and customers, but the closest to leaders.

𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀:

- Leaders who are still in the day-to-day
must balance and clarify their perspective.

- Leaders who are not involved in delivery
should still talk to customers regularly.

P.S. Who do you think businesses should put first? 👇

Example #2:

Business is hard, but you can make it easier.

→ Always solve 3 kinds of problems:

1️⃣ 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀
↳ Small problems you solve before the sale
to build trust and make the sale easier.

💡 Small problems stop people from:

• Identifying the main problem
• Taking the first step to solve it
• Solving part of the main problem

Examples of "small problems" for each:

• Why don't my posts get likes?
• How to start posting on LinkedIn?
• How to make visuals for my posts?

👉 To help people solve small problems
give away free but complete solutions.

These are usually lead magnets.

𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀:

• Content strategy call
• 30 viral post templates
• Canva guide for LinkedIn

🧲 Types of lead magnets:

• Memberships
• Assessments
• Workshops
• Consulting
• Templates
• Webinars
• Guides
• Trials

But you need to be strategic.

Avoid solutions that are:

• Unrelated to the main problem
• Incomplete or just teasers
• Costly $$$ to deliver

The next logical step for people
after you help them solve that issue
should be (obviously) to buy your main thing.

2️⃣ 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀
↳ Problems you solve as your core service,
for your regular price on your regular terms.

This is self-explanatory.
That's your thing.
Sell it.

But after you deliver the solution,
another opportunity comes up.

3️⃣ 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀
↳ Problems that show up after solving the main one.
Usually, solving the main problems enables these.

⚡️ That's where a lot of small businesses miss out.

Here's an example:

When you buy a car, you face a new set of problems:

• You need to cover liability
• You need to do maintenance
• You may want to upgrade the car

Dealerships help with all of it.

Here are 3 types of "desserts" you can serve,
after you solve the main problem for customers:

• Ascend – boost to a higher plan to hit the next goal
• Descend – downgrade to a maintenance plan
• Resell - sell the next product you have in line
• Refer – send to someone who can help next

Good businesses solve one problem.
Great ones keep solving the next.

P.S. Do you solve all 3 types of problems?👇

Example #3:

Use this map to guide people from Cold to Sold.

(stop shouting into the void, read this)

Every buyer walks the awareness path.
Use this map, and they'll start jogging.

Here are the 5 stages of awareness and
how to move people with your message:

🏭/ 𝗨𝗻𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 — 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗱, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹
↳ They don't know they have a problem,
but they experience symptoms of it.

↓ Call out the symptoms of a problem.
↓ Create an emotional connection.
↓ Label them with a problem.

→ Example:
"If your posts don't get much engagement,
and LinkedIn feels like a waste of time,
you have a weak content strategy..."

— — — — —

🏮/ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 — 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹
↳ Once they realize there's a problem,
they start looking for ways to solve it.

↓ Call out the specific problem.
↓ Educate about the consequences.
↓ Describe the types of solutions to it.

→ Example:
"Weak content strategy is the main reason
people burn out and quit LinkedIn too early.
But it doesn't have to be this way. Instead..."

— — — — —

🏯/ 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 — 𝗺𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹
↳ They've seen options, but they're unsure
what actually works, or what works for them.

↓ Call out various types of solutions.
↓ Educate about pros and cons of each.
↓ Introduce your solution as one of them.

→ Example: 
"3 ways to create content strategy: pillars,
awareness, calendar. Here's how to pick...
... But for our customers, we use ______ "

— — — — —

🏰/ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 — 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹
↳ Now they're comparing solution providers.
They need a reason to trust you over the rest.

↓ Call out a specific type of solution.
↓ Educate about your product of this type.
↓ Show the proof of that solution working.

→ Example: 
"Here's how we helped Stan to level-up
his content and get 10,000 followers by
refining his strategy with {product}..."

— — — — —

🏱/ 𝗠𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 — 𝗵𝗼𝘁, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗻'𝘁 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁
↳ Nearly there. They want your product.
They just need a little push to act now.

↓ Call out your product.
↓ Present the detailed offer.
↓ Add a specific incentive to act.

→ Example:
"Our {product} is now available for the
next {#} people with a {special bonus}
for {limited time}. Get it now to {outcome}."

— — — — —

Tailor your messaging to move your ICPs.

✅ Bonus notes:

→ Examples given to help understand, not copy-paste.
→ One message can move people up a few stages.
→ People forget, so repeat your messages a lot.

P.S. Are you AWARE of these stages (pun intended)? 👇

Example #4:

The small size of your business isn't the problem.

It's a competitive advantage you can leverage.

Here are 5 subtle advantages of being small,
and what to lean toward to win big:

1️⃣ 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱 
⮑ Business moves at the speed of communication.

✅ Quick decisions, lean meetings,
direct access, short feedback loops.

❌ Time zone gaps, tool overload,
management layers, bureaucracy.

2️⃣ 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆
⮑ Scarcity creates value. Exclusivity multiplies it.

✅ Limited capacity, high-touch service,
waitlists, premium pricing, retention-first.

❌ Mass offers, cookie-cutter approach,
volume-first, underqualifying, cheap price.

3️⃣ 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
⮑ One great solution is better than ten mediocre ones.

✅ Narrow niche, expert positioning,
high-skill delivery, specific problem.

❌ Broad appeal, unlimited customization,
too many offers, channels, or customer profiles.

4️⃣ 𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
⮑ Systems serve you, instead of you servicing them.

✅ Plug-and-play tools, lower operational costs,
contractors, remote teams, high risk-tolerance.

❌ Enterprise software, piles of checklists,
extra-safe bets, never-changing systems.

5️⃣ 𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
⮑ Small businesses bend. Big ones break.

✅ Fast pivots, antifragile, cross-team roles,
less legal or public scrutiny, high innovation.

❌ Slow calibration, fixed roles, outdated models,
internal resistance, high liability, high risk.

Small business isn't your weakness.
If you turn it into an unfair advantage.

Format #4: Psychology & Human Behavior

This format explores psychological concepts and human behavior patterns relevant to business. It combines research, statistics, and practical applications to help readers understand themselves and others better.

Attributes that make this format compelling:

- Opens with surprising statistics or counterintuitive psychological facts
- Names specific psychological concepts or biases
- Uses numbered lists to break down behavioral traits
- Provides practical solutions or ways to identify patterns
- Connects abstract psychology to concrete business outcomes
- Ends with self-reflection questions

Here are ideal examples of Format #4: Psychology & Human Behavior posts.

Example #1:

70% of leaders...
80% of workers...
93% of drivers...

... rate themselves above average.

Funny thing is, 90% can't be above average.

This effect is called the 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗕𝗶𝗮𝘀.

But it also causes massive issues in business:

• Poor decision-making
• Neglected feedback
• Hiring mistakes
• Team friction
• Stagnation

The best way to avoid this bias is this:

👉 Actively seek disconfirming feedback.

Here are 5 ways to get it:

1. Surround yourself with people who challenge you.
2. Ask for brutal feedback from smart people.
3. Benchmark yourself with real metrics.
4. Write down your predictions.
5. Judge the outcomes.

If you think you're above average,
change your reference group.

P.S. What skill are you above average in? 👇

♻️ Repost if you've seen this bias at work.
➕ Follow Lian for more growth content.

Example #2:

Most people fake support.

Here's how to spot the real ones.

1️⃣ They call you out on your BS.
- You know they'll hold you accountable.

2️⃣ They tell you their honest opinion.
- You're responsible for your feelings.

3️⃣ They help you move toward your goals.
- You can measure their impact on your life.

4️⃣ They don't expect anything in return.
- You know they don't keep the score.

5️⃣ They celebrate your wins as their own.
- You treat their success the same way.

6️⃣ They show up when it's inconvenient.
- You don't have to ask twice, they're around.

7️⃣ They praise in public and critique in private.
- You get the truth without the spotlight.

8️⃣ They remind you of your potential.
- You forget about it, they don't.

9️⃣ They don't need a reason to call you.
- You don't brace yourself for the ask.

🔟 They protect your name in rooms you're not in.
- You can trust them with your reputation.

Most people don't care about you.
These signs show you who does.

Do you have these people in your life?

Format #5: Contrarian Reality Checks

This format challenges popular feel-good beliefs with hard data and brutal honesty. It positions uncomfortable truths as more valuable than comforting lies.

Attributes that make this format compelling:

- Opens by listing popular "luxury beliefs" that everyone shares
- Uses hard statistics and data to contradict these beliefs
- Shows the gap between feel-good advice and harsh reality
- Uses arrows (→, ↳) to show real consequences
- Emphasizes radical ownership and personal responsibility
- Ends with a choice between comfort and truth

Here is an ideal example of Format #5: Contrarian Reality Checks posts.

Example #1:

Every day on LinkedIn, you hear:

— AI will not replace you...
— 99% of jobs can be taught...
— Start a business, work 4h a day...
— Hire based on passion and attitude...

👆These are luxury beliefs.

They exist to make people feel better.

This is the reality. 👇

→ Every minute on LinkedIn:
• 11,000 people apply for jobs
• 7 people get hired

→ During the first 5 years in business:
• 50% of businesses shut down
• 40% never make it to $1M

→ Based on the data available in 2025:
• 78% of global companies use AI
• 83% claim AI is a top priority

The moment we accept it, we get a chance to:

• Prepare
• Adapt
• Grow

Yes, chance. Not a guarantee. No one owes us sh*t.

Because feel-good quotes won't:

• Pay your bills
• Save your career
• Grow your business

But raw honesty and radical ownership will ✊.

**Final Delivery**

I am now going to give you the topic or angle I want to write about, and I would like you to give me a LinkedIn post in one of these five formats.

Each post must:
- Read like a standalone LinkedIn post without any formatting labels or headers
- Use emojis strategically for visual hierarchy (numbered emojis like 🏭/, special characters)
- Include specific examples, data points, or frameworks when relevant
- Have a clear hook, body with formatted sections, and conclusion
- End with a P.S. question to drive engagement
- Include calls-to-action (♻️ Share and ➕ Follow) with personalized messaging

The post should feel authentic, vulnerable where appropriate, and provide genuine value while maintaining the contrarian, no-BS tone that characterizes this writing style.
