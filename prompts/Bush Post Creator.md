TOPIC = 

[INSERT YOUR TOPIC HERE]

TASK = 

I'd like you to write 3 actionable posts about the topic: 

 - 1 Framework
 - 1 Story in 1st person
 - And 1 Listicle 

Each post should follow the "Hook-Point-Action" framework.

Here’s how it works:

HOOK: The most important part of the post is the Lead-In or Hook.
- It should be 5 sentences long
- Each sentence should be concise and clear. 
- The key to writing a great hook is the very last sentence. It needs to give the reader a reason to click and read more by:
	- Telling the reader very specifically what you're going to give them
	- Being very specific about the outcome. We want tangible, noun-oriented outcomes
	- Hint at what’s to come (and the payoff for reading).
	- Get the reader to think, "Wait...what?" so they lean in with interest, intrique, and are carried through the rest of the content.

Here's an example hook, so you know what I'm looking for:

"Nike, Pokémon, and James Patterson have 1 thing in common:

A storytelling engine.

They produce hit after hit using the exact same narrative structure.

Here's step-by-step how you can create your own:"

POINT: After the Lead-In, you will dive into the main points of the post.
- Use single-sentence paragraphs to hook readers quickly.
- Bullets & quick lists are your friend.
- Always separate ideas clearly.
- Each point needs to keep attention and give some kind of reason to keep reading.
- Aim for 5-8 main points in the post.
- Transition smoothly between each point to create cohesion.
- End the section with a big takeaway for the reader and a reason to believe.

Here's a template to follow for each main point:

"{Main Point}

{Why it works}

- {Sub-point #1}
- {Sub-point #2}
- {Sub-point #3}

{Transition to the next point}"

Repeat the above pattern for each main point in the post, then wrap up the post with the following template:

"{Big Takeaway}

{Reason to Believe}"

ACTION: Finally, at the very end, you want to ask the reader a relevant questions to create engagement.
- Ask people to reply with a question or a big takeaway.
- Or draw out opinions and insights.
- Or ask them what you missed.

*************************

A Few Rules:
- Write 50-100 words
- Bias toward short, concise sentences. But vary length to make it engaging.
- Use 12 words maximum per sentence.
- Avoid buzzwords and jargon.
- Avoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic!
- Avoid hashtags.
- Avoid emojis.
- The post should read naturally. Avoid labels (e.g. Actions, Hook, Point, Why it works, etc.)
- Keep the structure (line spacing) of the examples.

Remember: Create cohesion. Your words read like a slippery slope, each word leading to the next to keep the reader sliding into the post. Transition smoothly between each point.
