Format #1: Most Powerful

This format uses a strong, declarative statement to create an open loop in the mind of the reader - which they then have to click “See More” to find what the “Most Powerful” thing is. The line in parenthesis then either adds credibility or twists the knife by heightening pain of a problem or the benefit of solving it.

Example #1:

The single most powerful habit for personal growth:

(I've done this every morning for 5 years)

Journaling.

Example #2:

The most powerful reflection you can do:

(I've done this every month for 5 years)

The Monthly Review.

Example #3:

The highest leverage habit you can build:

(This might surprise you)

Writing on the internet.

Example #4:

The secret to writing online:

(It's not your hooks)

Saying 1 idea in 1,000 unique ways.


~
Format #2: Big Number vs Small Number

This format uses the contrast between a large number and a small number to create an open loop in the mind of the reader. The hook suggest a huge outcome can be achieved with a relatively low effort. This “effort” could be money, time, number of staff, etc. It uses social proof and aspirational appeal—suggesting readers can achieve similar success.

Example #1:

In 5 years, my little business has generated $15,000,000.

It runs on just $8,215/month.

Example #2:

In the last 5 years, 3 small mindset shifts helped me lose 100 pounds and write every single morning:

Example #3:

These 7 small (but powerful) habits helped me quit my Wall Street job and generate $15,000,000 on the internet: 

~
Format #3: The Call Out

This hook is compelling because it directly calls out the intended target audience. It uses a direct command with a specific, actionable number (e.g. 19 tips) targeting a specific audience. It offers easy to access, ready-to-use advice that can be immediately applied. 

Example 1: 

Writers:

Stick these 19 powerful writing tips to your desk:

~
Format #4: The Secret

This hook combines impressive proof with a cliffhanger question about "The Secret." It creates a curiosity gap—promising to reveal the key to an extraordinary result. It works because the target audience is called out as part of the first line, and directly appeals to their desire for success and the insider knowledge from someone who's achieved what they want.

Example 1:

Over the last 10 years, I've made $10,000,000+ as a writer.

The secret?

Example 2:

I'm not a "genius" writer. 

But writing online made me a millionaire:

My secret?

Example 3:

The people you look up to are nothing special.

The only difference?

~
Format #5: The Oddly Ignored

This hook positions the concept or framework after the colon as contrarian. It uses superlatives ("most underrated," "highest-leverage") and a specific, time-limited relevance (e.g. a year). It appeals to competitive advantage and FOMO—suggesting readers can gain an edge by mastering this overlooked skill/framework/concept. It works because people seek untapped opportunities for differentiation and success.

Example #1:

The most underrated, oddly-ignored, yet highest-leverage skill in 2025:

Lean Writing.

Example 2:

The most misunderstood, misused, yet highest-leverage writing skill of 2025:

Copywriting.

~
Format #6: The Struggle

This hook uses a relatable struggle followed by transformation, creating a before-and-after narrative with specific proof. It uses empathy and has an aspirational angle. It works because people want proven methods from someone who overcame similar challenges they’re currently facing.

Example #1:

I struggled for *years* to build a daily writing habit.

But now, I write for 90 minutes every single day:

Example #2:

My first book took me 4 years to write.

But now I can write an entire book in 30 days.

Example #3:

I'm not surprised I became a millionaire by my early 30s.

Because I put myself through hell in my 20s:

~
Format #7: How To

This hook addresses the audience's biggest fear (like running out of a resource) or points out the benefit of doing something while promising a specific solution within a certain timeframe. It uses frames a problem or benefit and gives reassurance for those suffering from that specific problem or those wanting to achieve a particular outcome. The final part (in parenthesis) of the hook acknowledges the reader's internal objections upfront, making the promise feel more inclusive and achievable. Or this part can be used to “Twist the Knife” which is either heightening the pain of not overcoming the problem or the benefit of overcoming the problem. 

Example #1:

How to generate 100 ideas to write about in 30 minutes (even if you think you have nothing interesting to say):

Example #2:

9 reasons why I'm writing every day in 2025 (this is one of the most powerful habits you can build):

Example #3:

How I generate 20 writing ideas every morning in under 5 minutes—without any “additional” work:

Example #2:

I studied the writing routine of 500 legendary writers. Anyone can be a great writer—if you follow these 6 simple habits:

~
Format #8: Belief Flip

This hook format takes a common limiting belief and contrasts it with shocking contradictory evidence from the writer’s own career or achievements. It uses belief transformation and social proof, dismantling myths about the topic in question. It works because it reframes the belief, and inspires the target audience to reconsider their own beliefs.

Example 1:

I used to think all writers died broke.

But I've generated $15,000,000 as a writer:

~
Format #9: The List

This hook format creates a curiosity gap by listing out 3 or more items about a specific topic. Because LinkedIn hooks have a limit of 3 lines before the reader has to click “See More” to reader the rest of the post, it creates an open loop because the reader wants to know everything else in the list. The list uses tangible language, with active verbs, numbers, and short & concise points. This makes it easy to read. 

Example #1:

At 22, I was:

• 280 pounds
• Drinking 40 beers a week
• Tens of thousands in debt

My life was a mess.

But reading 7 core beliefs every morning rewired my mindset (and changed my life):

Example #2:

Daily routine 6 years ago:

1. Screeching 5AM alarm
2. Immediately caffeinate
3. Have a pathetic morning workout
4. Work under fluorescent lights for 12 hours
5. Take freezing cold NYC subway home
6. Grab a 6 pack and sit on the couch
7. Smile & say I'm living the dream

But now?

Example #3:

I've spent 10,000+ hours ghostwriting for:

• Startup founders
• Olympic athletes
• NYT best-selling authors

Example #4:

I've generated over $5,000,000 ghostwriting.

• No fancy website
• No expensive tools
• No complex funnels

Just a simple cold outreach strategy.

~
Format #10: The Crazy Part

This hook uses credibility by giving a specific, impressive achievement followed by a curiosity gap ("the crazy part?"). It  combines social proof with intrigue—establishing authority while creating anticipation for counterintuitive insights. It works because readers want to learn surprising secrets from people ahead of them on their journey in the hope it will help them reach a particular milestone faster.

Example 1:

At 26, I quit my full-time job as a copywriter. But 60 days later, I hit $20k/month as a ghostwriter. The crazy part?

Example 2:

In 5 years, I wrote for 300+ industry leaders and made over $3,000,000 as a ghostwriter. But the crazy part?

~
Format #11: Everyone Should

This hook format uses universal empowerment for a specific audience or general audience ("everyone should") combined with a specific outcome. The second line adds specific, relatable pain points. It uses inclusive motivation and FOMO—making success seem both achievable and necessary.

Example 1:

Everyone should have a digital business making $10k/month.

Sadly, most overthink, never act, and waste years.

Example 2:

Everyone should have a writing business that makes at least $10k/month.

- The last sentence in a hook should end with a colon ":" if approrpiate.
- Don't use any formatting or headers
- Don't use hashtags
